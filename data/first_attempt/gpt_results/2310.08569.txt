INTRODUCTION Energy optimization and management in commercial buildings is a very important problem, whose importance is only growing with time. Buildings account for 39% of all US carbon emissions [13]. Reducing those emissions by even a small percentage can have a significant effect, especially in more extreme climates. Our contributions include a highly customizable and scalable HVAC and building simulator, a rapid configuration method to customize the simulator to a particular building, a calibration method to improve 1Available online: https://github.com/google/sbsim Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Overview of the HVAC problem Most office buildings are equipped with advanced HVAC devices, like Variable Air Volume (VAV) devices, Hot Water Systems (HWS), Air Conditioner (AC) and Air Handlers that are configured and tuned by the engineers, manufacturers, installers, and operators to run efficiently with the device’s local control loops [15]. However, integrating multiple HVAC devices from diverse vendors into a building “system” re- quires technicians to program fixed operating conditions for these units, which may not be optimal for every building and every poten- tial weather condition. If existing setpoint control policies are not optimal under all conditions, the possibility exists that an ML model may be trained to continuously tune a small number of setpoints to achieve greater energy efficiency and reduced carbon emission [22]. RL for HVAC systems We define the state of the office building 𝑆𝑡 at time 𝑡 as a fixed length vector of measurements from sensors on the building’s devices, such as a specific VAV’s zone air temperature, gas meter’s flow rate, etc. The action on the building 𝐴𝑡 is a fixed- length vector of device setpoints selected by the agent at time 𝑡, such as the boiler’s supply water temperature setpoint, etc. We also define a custom feedback signal, or reward, that indicates the quality of taking an action in the current state, as a weighted sum of negative cost functions for carbon emission, energy consumption, and zone-level setpoint deviation. The goal of RL is to maximize the expected long-term cumulative reward [18]. In order to converge to the optimal policy, the agent requires many training iterations, making training directly on the building from scratch inefficient and impracticable. Therefore, it is necessary to train in an offline sandbox environment that adequately emulates the dynamics of the building before being deployed on the actual building. 2 RELATED WORK Considerable attention has been paid to HVAC control in recent years, and a growing portion of that has considered how RL and its various associated algorithms can be leveraged [8, 14, 20, 23, 24]. A central requirement in RL is the offline environment that trains the RL agent. Several methods for this have been proposed, largely falling under three broad categories. Data-driven Emulators: Some works attempt to learn a dy- namics model as a multivariate regression model from real world data [25, 29], often using recurrent neural network architectures, such as LSTMs [16, 19, 28? ]. The difficulty here is that data-driven models often do not generalize well to circumstances outside the training distribution, especially since they are not physics based. RLEM ’23, November 11–12, 2023, Istanbul, Turkey Goldfeder and Sipple Physics-based Simulation: EnergyPlus [7], a high-fidelity sim- ulator developed by the Department of Energy, is commonly used [2, 21, 22, 27], but suffers from the scalability issues outlined above. Offline RL: The second approach is to train the agent directly from the historical real world data, without ever producing an in- teractive environment [4–6]. While the real world data is obviously of high accuracy and quality, this presents a major challenge, since the agent cannot take actions in the real world and interact with any form of an environment, severely limiting its ability to improve over the baseline policy that produced the real world data [10]. To overcome the limitations of each of the above three methods, some work has proposed a hybrid approach [3, 26], and this is the category our work falls under. Our approach uses a physics-based simulator that achieves an ideal balance between speed and fidelity, which is sufficient to train an effective control agent off-line. 3 A SIMPLE CALIBRATED SIMULATION Design Considerations A fundamental tradeoff when designing a simulator is speed versus fidelity. Fidelity is the simulator’s ability to reproduce the building’s true dynamics that affect the optimization process. Speed refers to both simulator configuration time, and agent training time, i.e., the time necessary for the agent to optimize its policy using the simulator. Every building is unique, due to its physical layout, equipment, and location. Fully customizing a high fidelity simulation to a specific target building requires nearly exhaustive knowledge of the building structure, materials, location, etc., some of which is unknowable. Also, the configuration time required for high-fidelity simulations limits their utility for deploying RL-based optimization to many buildings. Our goal is to develop a method for applying RL at scale to commercial buildings. To this end, we must have a simulated environment to train the agent, as real world training is not possible. In order to scale to many buildings it must be easy for our simulator to be configured to a new building, with enough fidelity to the real world to be useful. We note that while RL is the control method proposed in this work, our calibrated simulator is useful as well for other controller methods such as Model Predictive Control [9]. To meet these requirements we designed a lightweight simulator based on Finite Differences approximation of heat exchange, with a novel automated procedure to go from building floor plans to a custom simulator with little manual effort. For improved fidelity, we designed a calibration and evaluation pipeline based on real telemetry. Building Thermal Model We developed our simulation around our abstract thermal model for office buildings, shown in Figure 1. A building consists of conditioned zones, where the measured zone temperature, 𝑇𝑧, should be within upper and lower setpoints, ˆ𝑇𝑧,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and ˆ𝑇𝑧,𝑚𝑖𝑛. Thermal power for heating or cooling is supplied to each zone, (cid:164)𝑄𝑠 , and recirculated from the zone, (cid:164)𝑄𝑟 from the HVAC system, with additional thermal exchange (cid:164)𝑄𝑧 from walls, doors, etc. The Air Handler supplies the building with air at supply air temperature setpoint ˆ𝑇𝑠 drawing fresh air, (cid:164)𝑚𝑎𝑚𝑏 at ambient temperatures, 𝑇𝑎𝑚𝑏 and returning exhaust air (cid:164)𝑚𝑒𝑥ℎ𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑡 at temperature 𝑇𝑒𝑥ℎ𝑎𝑢𝑠𝑡 to the outside using intake and exhaust fans: (cid:164)𝑊𝑎,𝑖𝑛 and (cid:164)𝑊𝑎,𝑜𝑢𝑡 . Some of the return air can be recirculated, (cid:164)𝑚𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑟𝑐 . Central air conditioning is achieved with a chiller and pump that joins a refrigeration cycle to the supply air, consuming electrical energy for the AC compressor (cid:164)𝑊𝑐 and coolant circulation, (cid:164)𝑊𝑐,𝑝 . The hot water cycle consists of a boiler that maintains the supply water temperature at 𝑇𝑏 heated by natural gas power (cid:164)𝑄𝑏 , and a pump that circulates hot water through the building, with electrical power (cid:164)𝑊𝑏,𝑝 . Supply air is delivered to the zones through VAV devices. We selected water supply temperature ˆ𝑇𝑏 and the air handler supply temperature ˆ𝑇𝑠 as agent actions because they affect the balance of electricity and natural gas consumption, they affect multiple device interactions, and they affect occupant comfort. Finite Differences Approximation The diffusion of thermal energy in time and space of the building can be approximated using the method of Finite Differences (FD)[12, 17], and applying an energy balance. This method divides each floor of the building into a grid of three-dimensional control volumes and applies thermal diffusion equations to estimate the temperature of each control volume. By assuming each floor is thermally isolated, (i.e., no heat is transferred between floors), we can simplify the three-spatial dimensions into a spatial two-dimensional heat transfer problem. Each control volume is a narrow volume bounded horizontally, parameterized by Δ𝑥 2, and vertically by the height of the floor. The energy balance, shown below, is applied to each discrete control volume in the FD grid, and consists of the following components: (a) the thermal exchange across each face of the four participating faces control volume via conduction or convection 𝑄1, 𝑄2, 𝑄3, 𝑄4, (b) the change in internal energy over time in the control volume 𝑀𝑐 Δ𝑇 Δ𝑡 , and (c) an external energy source that enables applying local thermal energy from the HVAC model only for those control volumes that include an airflow diffuser, 𝑄𝑒𝑥𝑡 . The equation is 𝑄𝑒𝑥𝑡 +𝑄1 +𝑄2 +𝑄3 +𝑄4 = 𝑀𝑐 Δ𝑇 Δ𝑡 , where 𝑀 is the mass and 𝑐 is the heat capacity of the control volume, Δ𝑇 is the temperature change from the prior timestep and Δ𝑡 is the timestep interval. Figure 1: Building Thermal Model The thermal exchange in (a) is calculated using Fourier’s law of steady conduction in the interior control volumes (walls and interior air), parameterized by the conductivity of the volume, and the exchange across the exterior faces of control volumes is cal- culated using the forced convection equation, parameterized by the convection coefficient, which approximates winds and currents surrounding the building. The change in internal energy (b) is pa- rameterized by the density, and heat capacity of the control volume. A Lightweight Calibrated Simulation Enabling Efficient Offline Learning for Optimal Control of Real Buildings RLEM ’23, November 11–12, 2023, Istanbul, Turkey Finally, the thermal energy associated with the VAV (c) is equally distributed to all associated control volumes that have a diffuser. Thermal diffusion within the building is mainly accomplished via forced or natural convection currents, which can be notoriously difficult to estimate accurately. We note that heat transfer using air circulation is effectively the exchange of air mass between control volumes, which we approximate by a randomized shuffling of air within zones, parameterized by a shuffle probability. HVAC Model The HVAC system is modeled as an energy bal- ance with a lossy thermal exchange between the hot water and air circuits, evaluating temperature differences, and air and water flow rates with efficiency parameters. Aggregate heating and cooling demands at the AC and HWS are governed by thermostats that create demand when its zone temperature is near zone air tempera- ture setpoints. Special control volumes associated with air diffusers allow thermal energy exchange between the HVAC model and the FD grid, (cid:164)𝑄𝑠 . Simulator Configuration For RL to scale to many buildings, it is critical to be able to easily and rapidly configure the simulator to any arbitrary building. To configure the simulator, we require floorplans, and HVAC metadata. We preprocess the detailed floor- plan blueprints of the building, and extract a grid that gives us an approximate placement of walls. We also employ a user interface to label the location of each HVAC device on the floorplan grid. We tested this pipeline on our pilot building, which consisted of two floors with combined surface area of 68,000 ft2, and 127 HVAC devices. Given floorplans and HVAC layout information, a single technician was able to generate a fully specified simulation in under 3 hours that matched the real building in every device and room. Simulator Calibration and Evaluation In order to calibrate the simulator to the real world using data, we must have a metric with which to evaluate our simulator, and an optimization method to improve our simulator on this metric. We proposed a novel evaluation procedure, based on 𝑁 -step prediction. Each iteration step of our simulator was designed to represent a five minute in- terval, and our real world data is also sampled in five minute in- tervals. To evaluate the simulator, we take a chunk of real data of 𝑁 observations. We then initialize the simulator so that its ini- tial state matches that of the starting observation, and run the simulator for 𝑁 steps, replaying the same HVAC policy as was used in the real world observations. Next, we calculate our sim- ulation fidelity metric, which is the mean absolute error of the measured zone air temperatures, at the 𝑁 th timestep. More for- mally, we define the spatial Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 𝑍 zones at timestep 𝑡 as 𝜖𝑡 = 1 𝑧=1 |𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙,𝑡,𝑧 − 𝑇𝑠𝑖𝑚,𝑡,𝑧 |, where 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙,𝑡,𝑧 𝑍 is the measured zone air temperature for zone 𝑧 at timestamp 𝑡, and 𝑇𝑠𝑖𝑚,𝑡,𝑧 = 1 𝑇𝑡,𝑐 is the mean temperature of all control 𝐶𝑧 volumes 𝐶𝑧 in zone 𝑧 at time 𝑡. Thus, to evaluate the simulator on 𝑁 -step prediction, we run the simulator for timesteps 0 to 𝑁 − 1, and calculate the above metric for 𝑡 = 𝑁 − 1. (cid:205)𝐶𝑧 𝑐=1 (cid:205)𝑍 Simulator Calibration Once we defined our simulation fidelity metric, we can minimize the error by searching over the physical parameters that affect the simulation response. The variables tuned during the parameter search included the following: (a) the forced convection coefficient quantifying outside wind and air currents against the building exterior surfaces; (b) the thermal conductivity, heat
