Abstract

Probabilities of Causation (PoC) play a fundamental role in
decision-making in law, health care and public policy. Nev-
ertheless, their point identification is challenging, requiring
strong assumptions, in the absence of which only bounds
can be derived. Existing work to further tighten these bounds
by leveraging extra information either provides numerical
bounds, symbolic bounds for fixed dimensionality, or re-
quires access to multiple datasets that contain the same treat-
ment and outcome variables. However, in many clinical, epi-
demiological and public policy applications, there exist ex-
ternal datasets that examine the effect of different treatments
on the same outcome variable, or study the association be-
tween covariates and the outcome variable. These external
datasets cannot be used in conjunction with the aforemen-
tioned bounds, since the former may entail different treat-
ment assignment mechanisms, or even obey different causal
structures. Here, we provide symbolic bounds on the PoC for
this challenging scenario. We focus on combining either two
randomized experiments studying different treatments, or a
randomized experiment and an observational study, assum-
ing causal sufficiency. Our symbolic bounds work for arbi-
trary dimensionality of covariates and treatment, and we dis-
cuss the conditions under which these bounds are tighter than
existing bounds in literature. Finally, our bounds parameter-
ize the difference in treatment assignment mechanism across
datasets, allowing the mechanisms to vary across datasets
while still allowing causal information to be transferred from
the external dataset to the target dataset.
