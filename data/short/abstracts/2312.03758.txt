Abstract—Predicting stock market is vital for investors and
policymakers, acting as a barometer of the economic health. We
leverage social media data, a potent source of public sentiment, in
tandem with macroeconomic indicators as government-compiled
statistics, to refine stock market predictions. However, prior
research using tweet data for stock market prediction faces
three challenges. First, the quality of tweets varies widely. While
many are filled with noise and irrelevant details, only a few
genuinely mirror the actual market scenario. Second, solely
focusing on the historical data of a particular stock without
considering its sector can lead to oversight. Stocks within the
same industry often exhibit correlated price behaviors. Lastly,
simply forecasting the direction of price movement without
assessing its magnitude is of limited value, as the extent of the rise
or fall truly determines profitability. In this paper, diverging from
the conventional methods, we pioneer an ECON (A Framework
Leveraging Tweets, Macroeconomic Indicators, and Historical
Prices to Predict Stock Movement and Volatility). The framework
has following advantages: First, ECON has an adept tweets filter
that efficiently extracts and decodes the vast array of tweet
data. Second, ECON discerns multi-level relationships among
stocks, sectors, and macroeconomic factors through a self-aware
mechanism in semantic space. Third, ECON offers enhanced
accuracy in predicting substantial stock price fluctuations by
capitalizing on stock price movement. We showcase the state-
of-the-art performance of our proposed model using a dataset,
specifically curated by us, for predicting stock market movements
and volatility.
