Abstract

Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) aims to adapt
a model trained on a source domain to a target domain
that undergoes distribution shift and contains samples from
novel classes outside the source domain. Source-free OSDA
(SF-OSDA) techniques eliminate the need to access source
domain samples, but current SF-OSDA methods utilize only
the known classes in the target domain for adaptation, and
require access to the entire target domain even during in-
ference after adaptation, to make the distinction between
known and unknown samples. In this paper, we introduce
Unknown Sample Discovery (USD) as an SF-OSDA method
that utilizes a temporally ensembled teacher model to con-
duct known-unknown target sample separation and adapts
the student model to the target domain over all classes using
co-training and temporal consistency between the teacher
and the student. USD promotes Jensen-Shannon distance
(JSD) as an effective measure for known-unknown sample
separation. Our teacher-student framework significantly re-
duces error accumulation resulting from imperfect known-
unknown sample separation, while curriculum guidance
helps to reliably learn the distinction between target known
and target unknown subspaces. USD appends the target
model with an unknown class node, thus readily classifying
a target sample into any of the known or unknown classes in
subsequent post-adaptation inference stages. Empirical re-
sults show that USD is superior to existing SF-OSDA meth-
ods and is competitive with current OSDA models that uti-
lize both source and target domains during adaptation.
