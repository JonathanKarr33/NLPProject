ABSTRACT

This project report summarizes our journey to perform sta-
ble diffusion fine-tuning on a dataset containing Calvin and
Hobbes comics. The purpose is to convert any given input
image into the comic style of Calvin and Hobbes, essentially
performing style transfer. We train stable-diffusion-v1.5 us-
ing Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently speed up the
fine-tuning process. The diffusion itself is handled by a Vari-
ational Autoencoder (VAE), which is a U-net. Our results
were visually appealing for the amount of training time and
the quality of input data that went into training.
