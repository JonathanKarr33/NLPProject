Abstract

Face clustering tasks can learn hierarchical semantic infor-
mation from large-scale data, which has the potential to help
facilitate face recognition. However, there are few works on
this problem. This paper explores it by proposing a joint op-
timization task of label classification and supervised con-
trastive clustering to introduce the cluster knowledge to the
traditional face recognition task in two ways. We first extend
ArcFace with a cluster-guided angular margin to adjust the
within-class feature distribution according to the hard level
of face clustering. Secondly, we propose a supervised con-
trastive clustering approach to pull the features to the cluster
center and propose the cluster-aligning procedure to align the
cluster center and the learnable class center in the classifier
for joint training. Finally, extensive qualitative and quantita-
tive experiments on popular facial benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our paradigm and its superiority over the
existing approaches to face recognition.
