ABSTRACT

Given a set of candidate entities (e.g. movie titles), the ability to
identify similar entities is a core capability of many recommender
systems. Most often this is achieved by collaborative filtering ap-
proaches, i.e. if users co-engage with a pair of entities frequently
enough, their embeddings should be similar. However, relying on
co-engagement data alone can result in lower-quality embeddings
for new and unpopular entities. We study this problem in the con-
text recommender systems at Netflix. We observe that there is
abundant semantic information such as genre, content maturity
level, themes, etc. that complements co-engagement signals and
provides interpretability in similarity models. To learn entity sim-
ilarities from both data sources holistically, we propose a novel
graph-based approach called SemanticGNN. SemanticGNN models
entities, semantic concepts, collaborative edges, and semantic edges
within a large-scale knowledge graph and conducts representation
learning over it. Our key technical contributions are twofold: (1)
we develop a novel relation-aware attention graph neural network
(GNN) to handle the imbalanced distribution of relation types in
our graph; (2) to handle web-scale graph data that has millions of
nodes and billions of edges, we develop a novel distributed graph
training paradigm. The proposed model is successfully deployed
within Netflix and empirical experiments indicate it yields up to
35% improvement in performance on similarity judgment tasks.
