Abstract—Voice recognition technology enables the execution
of real-world operations through a single voice command. This
paper introduces a voice recognition system that involves con-
verting input voice signals into corresponding text using an
Android application. The text messages are then transmitted
through Bluetooth connectivity, serving as a communication
platform. Simultaneously, a controller circuit, equipped with a
Bluetooth module, receives the text signal and, following a coding
mechanism, executes real-world operations. The paper extends
the application of voice recognition to real-time surveillance
and automation, incorporating obstacle detection and avoidance
mechanisms, as well as control over lighting and horn functions
through predefined voice commands. The proposed technique not
only serves as an assistive tool for individuals with disabilities
but also finds utility in industrial automation, enabling robots to
perform specific tasks with precision.
