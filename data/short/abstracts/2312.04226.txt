Abstract. In recent years, we have seen an increase in the adoption of
blockchain-based systems in non-financial applications, looking to ben-
efit from what the technology has to offer. Although many fields have
managed to include blockchain in their core functionalities, the adoption
of blockchain, in general, is constrained by the so-called trilemma trade-
off between decentralization, scalability, and security. In our previous
work, we have shown that using a digital twin for dynamically manag-
ing blockchain systems during runtime can be effective in managing the
trilemma trade-off. Our Digital Twin leverages DDDAS feedback loop,
which is responsible for getting the data from the system to the digital
twin, conducting optimisation, and updating the physical system. This
paper examines how leveraging DDDAS feedback loop can support the
optimisation component of the trilemma benefiting from Reinforcement
Learning agent and a simulation component to augment the quality of
the learned model while reducing the computational overhead required
for decision making.
