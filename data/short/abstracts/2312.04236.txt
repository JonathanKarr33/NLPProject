Abstract

We introduce a pipeline to address anatomical
inaccuracies in Stable Diffusion generated hand
images. The initial step involves constructing
a specialized dataset, focusing on hand anoma-
lies, to train our models effectively. A finetuned
detection model is pivotal for precise identifica-
tion of these anomalies, ensuring targeted correc-
tion. Body pose estimation aids in understanding
hand orientation and positioning, crucial for ac-
curate anomaly correction. The integration of
ControlNet and InstructPix2Pix facilitates sophis-
ticated inpainting and pixel-level transformation,
respectively. This dual approach allows for high-
fidelity image adjustments. This comprehensive
approach ensures the generation of images with
anatomically accurate hands, closely resembling
real-world appearances. Our experimental results
demonstrate the pipelineâ€™s efficacy in enhancing
hand image realism in Stable Diffusion outputs.
