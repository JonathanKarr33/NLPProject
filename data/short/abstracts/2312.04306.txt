Abstract

We present nerblackbox, a python library to
facilitate the use of state-of-the-art transformer-
based models for named entity recognition. It
provides simple-to-use yet powerful methods
to access data and models from a wide range of
sources, for fully automated model training and
evaluation as well as versatile model inference.
While many technical challenges are solved
and hidden from the user by default, nerblack-
box also offers fine-grained control and a rich
set of customizable features. It is thus targeted
both at application-oriented developers as well
as machine learning experts and researchers.
