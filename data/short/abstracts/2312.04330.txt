Abstract

The modeling and forecasting of sea ice conditions in the
Arctic region are important tasks for ship routing, offshore
oil production, and environmental monitoring. We propose
the adaptive surrogate modeling approach named LANE-SI
(Lightweight Automated Neural Ensembling for Sea Ice) that
uses ensemble of relatively simple deep learning models with
different loss functions for forecasting of spatial distribution
for sea ice concentration in the specified water area.
Experimental studies confirm the quality of a long-term fore-
cast based on a deep learning model fitted to the specific water
area is comparable to resource-intensive physical modeling,
and for some periods of the year, it is superior. We achieved a
20% improvement against the state-of-the-art physics-based
forecast system SEAS5 for the Kara Sea.
