Abstract

Pesticides serve as a common tool in agricultural pest control but significantly
contribute to the climate crisis. To combat this, Integrated Pest Management
(IPM) stands as a climate-smart alternative. Despite its potential, IPM faces low
adoption rates due to farmersâ€™ skepticism about its effectiveness. To address this
challenge, we introduce an advanced data analysis framework tailored to enhance
IPM adoption. Our framework provides i) robust pest population predictions
across diverse environments with invariant and causal learning, ii) interpretable
pest presence predictions using transparent models, iii) actionable advice through
counterfactual explanations for in-season IPM interventions, iv) field-specific
treatment effect estimations, and v) assessments of the effectiveness of our advice
using causal inference. By incorporating these features, our framework aims
to alleviate skepticism and encourage wider adoption of IPM practices among
farmers.
