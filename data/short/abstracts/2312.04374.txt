Abstract—Autonomous racing is a critical research area for
autonomous driving, presenting significant challenges in vehicle
dynamics modeling, such as balancing model precision and
computational efficiency at high speeds (> 280km h−1), where
minor errors in modeling have severe consequences. Existing
physics-based models for vehicle dynamics require elaborate
testing setups and tuning, which are hard to implement, time-
intensive, and cost-prohibitive. Conversely, purely data-driven
approaches do not generalize well and cannot adequately en-
sure physical constraints on predictions. This paper introduces
Deep Dynamics, a physics-informed neural network (PINN)
for vehicle dynamics modeling of an autonomous racecar. It
combines physics coefficient estimation and dynamical equations
to accurately predict vehicle states at high speeds and includes
a unique Physics Guard layer to ensure internal coefficient
estimates remain within their nominal physical ranges. Open-
loop and closed-loop performance assessments, using a physics-
based simulator and full-scale autonomous Indy racecar data,
highlight Deep Dynamics as a promising approach for modeling
racecar vehicle dynamics.
