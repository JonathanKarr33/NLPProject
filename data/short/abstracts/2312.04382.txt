Abstract

In this paper, we propose the Adversarial Denoising Diffusion Model (ADDM).
The ADDM is based on the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) but
complementarily trained by adversarial learning. The proposed adversarial learning
is achieved by classifying model-based denoised samples and samples to which
random Gaussian noise is added to a specific sampling step. With the addition
of explicit adversarial learning on data samples, ADDM can learn the semantic
characteristics of the data more robustly during training, which achieves a similar
data sampling performance with much fewer sampling steps than DDPM. We apply
ADDM to anomaly detection in unsupervised MRI images. Experimental results
show that the proposed ADDM outperformed existing generative model-based
unsupervised anomaly detection methods. In particular, compared to other DDPM-
based anomaly detection methods, the proposed ADDM shows better performance
with the same number of sampling steps and similar performance with 50% fewer
sampling steps.
