Abstract— Pedestrian trajectory prediction, vital for self-
driving cars and socially-aware robots, is complicated due to
intricate interactions between pedestrians, their environment,
and other Vulnerable Road Users. This paper presents GS-
GFormer, an innovative generative model adept at predicting
pedestrian trajectories by considering these complex interac-
tions and offering a plethora of potential modal behaviors. We
incorporate a heterogeneous graph neural network to capture
interactions between pedestrians, semantic maps, and potential
destinations. The Transformer module extracts temporal fea-
tures, while our novel CVAE-Residual-GMM module promotes
diverse behavioral modality generation. Through evaluations
on multiple public datasets, GSGFormer not only outperforms
leading methods with ample data but also remains competitive
when data is limited.
