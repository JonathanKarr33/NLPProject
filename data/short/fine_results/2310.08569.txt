ABSTRACT

Energy consumption in office buildings is a target for envi- ronmental improvement , as they account for 18 % of the total energy consumption in the United States , and heating , ventila- tion , and air conditioning ( HVAC ) are generally the largest contributors due to their high consumption of electricity and natural gas. At a finer level , a building might go over its electric- ity peak and thus incur higher demand charges for the entire year , which can comprise 30 %-70 % of a companyâ€™s annual elec- tricity bill . This is the problem that was attacked in our colaboration with Google SRE , to model and train an AI control system for real buildings to reduce their overall energy consumption. The difficul- ty is producing large amounts of real world training data for this model from actual buildings , so we produced a high fidelity physics-based simulator to produce this data. This paper details the architecture of the simulator , our calibration procedure , and the results of a single building we are applying the model to.

Discussion We want to emphasize that these results are taken from only one building , and as we include more buildings , more insight can be gained into what is important to calibrate . However , these results show us that our time-consuming process of configuration , calibration of simu- lator , and training of agent in simulation environment is a fruitful goal , and that in multi building environment , this time cost could bear valuable fruit . Full video results and a little more detail about the calibration metric can be found in our supplementary materials at https : //github.com/google/sbsim

5 CONCLUSION

Our collaboration with Google SRE is at an early stage , and hence in this paper , we have utilized only results from the pilot building . It is encouraging that the simulator is built in a few hours and produces high-fidelity enough data to help the agent to train itself in offline environment effectively . Our next step is to get these control agents deployed on actual buildings and see how well they do at saving energy at larger scale . Given that heating is only one part of the energy problem in buildings , there are likely many other applications for a calibrated building simulator especially when paired with reinforcement learn- ing methods to figure out an optimal set of actions , and even for just studying overall heating consumption calibrating against real world data can be enlightening. 6 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We acknowledge the crucial contribution made by Eric Chung , Principal Program Manager , Microsoft Tech- nology Center in the early stage of design of our simulation and data pipeline , and Alexander Veiden- baum of LBNL and Elsa Culler of Northern Arizona University in the critical discussion of our calibra- tion methodology.
