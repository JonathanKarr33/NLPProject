The paper addresses the important problem of energy optimization and management in commercial buildings, which contribute significantly to carbon emissions. The authors propose a highly customizable and scalable HVAC and building simulator, a rapid configuration method, a calibration method, and an evaluation method to measure simulator fidelity. The paper discusses the HVAC problem in office buildings, defines the state and action for an office building, and introduces reinforcement learning (RL) for HVAC systems. The paper also reviews previous work on HVAC control and offline RL methods. The authors present a lightweight calibrated simulation for efficient offline learning and demonstrate the results of their simulator on a pilot building, showing good generalization and low spatial errors. The paper concludes by discussing future work and potential improvements for the simulator and RL agent.

In summary, the paper introduces a novel approach to energy optimization and management in commercial buildings using a customizable and scalable simulator, reinforcement learning, and offline training. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach on a pilot building and suggests further improvements and future work.
