This paper presents a highly customizable and scalable HVAC and building simulator, along with methods for rapid configuration and calibration. The paper discusses the challenges of integrating multiple HVAC devices into a building system and proposes using reinforcement learning (RL) for HVAC controls. It also explores the use of physics-based simulators for training control agents and provides insights into the simulation fidelity and calibration results. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the simulator in making real-world predictions and highlights areas for improvement in the modeling approach.
