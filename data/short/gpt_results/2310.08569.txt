This paper focuses on the development of a lightweight and customizable simulator for use in optimizing energy management in commercial HVAC systems. The simulator is calibrated and evaluated using real-world data to ensure accuracy. The paper also discusses the challenges of training reinforcement learning agents directly on the building and the need for a simulated environment for training. The results of calibration and validation show promising accuracy and generalizability of the simulator. The paper outlines future work that includes improving the simulator by adding a radiative heat transfer model, expanding the action space, and using data-driven predictor-corrector models. Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to optimizing energy management in commercial buildings using a calibrated simulator and reinforcement learning agents.
