The introduction section of this paper discusses the role of the stock market in the U.S. economy and presents a study focusing on blue-chip stocks. It outlines the limitations of current research on stock market prediction and introduces ECON, a new framework for predicting stock movement and volatility. The framework is designed to integrate tweet data and macroeconomic indicators to improve the accuracy of predictions. The paper also describes the structure of ECON and the methodology for data ingestion, sentiment analysis of Twitter data, and tweet filtering. It also presents the results of experiments using Cram√©r's V to determine the correlation between daily tweets and stock price movements.
