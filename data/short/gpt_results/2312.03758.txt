INTRODUCTION The stock market, a vital mechanism for facilitating stock trading and crucial capital raising for companies, exerts a significant influence on other business sectors [1]. Over the past few years, the U.S. stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio1 nearly exceeded 200%, and despite a slight dip in 2023, it has stabilized at around 150%. This prominence underscores the stock market’s role as a key indicator of the U.S. economy. Blue-chip stocks2, serving as a microcosm of the stock market, become the focus of our research. Our study on the financial market employs a selection of 42 blue-chip stocks from 10 Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) 3 Sectors, each deemed as investment-worthy4 by both Moody’s and S&P. Acknowledg- ing the inherent unpredictability of precise stock prices [2], our research leverages these blue-chip stocks to forecast future trends in stock price movement and volatility [3], [4]. Research within the realm of the stock market generally falls into two branches: technical analysis and fundamental analysis. Technical analysis employs historical stock prices as features to forecast future movements [5]. However, it is heavily reliant on past data, and often fails to account for abrupt market shifts triggered by unforeseen events. This methodology also assumes uniform rational market behavior, potentially leading to an echo chamber effect where trading signals self-reinforce, detaching from the underlying economic reality. Fundamental analysis, on the other hand, incorporates not only price features but also external information, such as social media data [6] and search engine data [7]. Mao et al. [8] shows the accuracy of predicting the S&P 500 closing price increases when Twitter5 data is incorporated into their model. Commonly, these data sources often serve as valuable indica- tors, mirroring not just the financial market but also other key economic indicators. However, current fundamental analysis research predominantly focuses on the historical information of individual stock [9], overlooking the interplay between the macro-economy and the stock market. Moreover, the existing models are primarily focused on predicting whether trends will change [10], but overlook the significance of the magnitude of such changes. In reality, the extent of these changes constitutes an important part of stock behavior. In this paper, to address the aforementioned limita- 3GICS is a method for assigning companies to a specific economic sector and industry group that best defines its business operations. 1The ratio is a measure of the total value of all publicly traded stocks in a 4Investment-worthy refers to high-quality companies rated Baa or higher market divided by that economy’s gross domestic product (GDP). according to evaluations by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s (S&P). 2A blue chip stock is stock issued by a large, well-established, financially- 5Although Twitter has recently been re-branded to “X”, this article contin- sound company with an excellent reputation. ues to use the original name, “Twitter”. 979-8-3503-2445-7/23/$31.00 ©2023 IEEE tions, we propose ECON (A Framework Leveraging Tweets, Macroeconomic Indicators, and Historical Prices to Predict Stock Movement and Volatility). Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • Designing an efficient framework for tweet data extraction in financial domain. The framework employs a sophisticated tweet filtering mechanism. By effectively re- moving redundant content and minimizing noise, it focuses on capturing tweets that genuinely mirror market sentiments. This optimized approach not only reduces the computational strain, which in turn allows for a more cost-effective device setup, but also enhances the accuracy of our subsequent market predictions. • Developing a self-aware mechanism for multi-level dynamic financial analysis. The proposed ECON learns the dynamic and temporal distance-based relationships inherent within stocks, sectors, and macroeconomic factors through a self-aware process. This allows ECON to not only focus on individual stocks but also to harness effective market information by hedging against macro and micro trends. • Formulating a multi-dimensional perception of stock market in a multi-task fashion. By integrating multi- dimensional correlations of stock market, we can not only predict stock price movements but also efficiently extract information from stock market volatility. By capitalizing the same day stock price movements, the model greatly amplifies its precision in predicting stock market volatility. This allows us to provide advance warning of any unusual fluctuations in the stock market in the future. • Validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the pro- posed model via comprehensive experiments. We conduct experiments on one real-world dataset6. Both conventional methods and deep learning based methods for stock mar- ket movements and volatility are selected for comparisons. Evaluations of various metrics are presented, illustrating the effectiveness of our proposed model. II. RELATED WORK Methods for predicting stock movement predominantly clas- sify into two main categories: technical analysis and funda- mental analysis. Technical analysis strictly hinges on historical prices to forecast future movements. In contrast, fundamental analysis casts a wider net, just historical prices but also data from textual sources, economic indicators, financial metrics, and a diverse range of both qualitative and quantitative factors. integrating not A. Technical analysis Technical analysis harnesses the historical prices of stocks as predictive features for future movements. The majority of contemporary methods employ deep learning architectures to unravel stock trends. Prominently, recurrent neural networks, with LSTM as a standout example, have been instrumental in identifying the temporal dynamics of stock prices [11]. 6Our dataset is available at https://github.com/hao1zhao/Bigdata23. The integration of temporal attention mechanisms has fur- ther enhanced the effectiveness of RNN-based models by amalgamating information from multiple time points [12]. Moreover, other sophisticated neural frameworks, such as convolutional neural networks and the Distillation model [13], have demonstrated their aptitude in capturing the intricate non- linear behaviors inherent to stock prices. A significant drawback of these methods is their inability to forecast price movements when the necessary information is absent from historical prices. In this paper, our foremost objective is to surpass these technical strategies by adeptly integrating tweet and macroeconomic data into our model. B. Fundamental analysis It is widely believed that information sources such as tweets, or government reports give meaningful evidence for stock price prediction. Most fundamental analysis studies concerning the financial market utilize text information for stock price prediction, often employing data sources such as social media, news articles, web search queries, or government documents. Social Media: Various studies have ventured into predicting stock market leveraging social media data. Recent research employs sentiment analysis to fuse historical price data with insights gathered from platforms like Yahoo’s message board [14] , blogs [15], Twitter [4], and Reddit [16], subsequently uncovering correlations with stock market trends. News and Search Engine: Research has delved into the intersection of public news and user browsing activity, inves- tigating their influence on traders’ reactions to news events. Studies like those by Xiong et al. [17] view Google trends and market data as drivers behind daily S&P 500 fluctuations. Other research, such as that by Bordino et al. [18], correlates search query traffic with stock movements. Advanced methods, such as the hierarchical attention mechanisms proposed by Hu et al. [19], mine news sequences directly from texts for stock trend prediction. Macroeconomic Indicators: Studies have identified a mul- titude of economic factors that contribute to the determination of stock returns. Particularly, Ferson et al. [20] demonstrates that interest rates play a pivotal role in shaping stock returns. Furthermore, Jank et al. [21] suggests additional indicators like the relative T-Bill rate and the consumption-wealth ratio to be significant predictors. Besides these factors, economic indi- cators such as unemployment rates, inflation, and commodity prices have also been proven to notably influence stock returns [22]. However, previous studies utilizing social network data present two significant limitations. First, their predictions of stock movements concentrate solely on the company, over- looking the broader context of its industry, even though the two are deeply interconnected. Second, these studies do not incorporate a reliable information filtering mechanism, making them susceptible to the plethora of misinformation prevalent on social platforms and public media. This over-reliance can compromise the accuracy of stock movement predictions. Figure 1: The architecture of ECON is designed to predict the movement yst v of stock s on day t. In the data input phase, information related to stock prices and macroeconomic factors is extracted. An optimal subset of tweet data is chosen via the tweet filter. Once company specifics are masked, ECON derives sector and tweet embeddings through self-aware mechanism, subsequently generating macro and micro trend features. The attention GRU amalgamates these two trends with the stock price features to make predictions. m, and volatility yst In this study, we aim to overcome the limitations of previous methodologies. We adopt an efficient tweet filter to eliminate redundant content and reduce noise. Additionally, we embrace a multi-dimensional approach to the stock market, integrating correlations of stock market information in a multi-task man- ner. By skillfully combining the strengths of both technical and model, we achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting stock movements. III. PROBLEM SETUP We offer a formal definition for the problem of predicting stock movement and volatility. Let S denote a set of target stocks for which predictions are sought. We define a set xst of feature vectors, with s ∈ S and t ∈ T , which encapsulate historical prices. Let T represents the set of available training days. In addition, we identify a set ε consisting of tweets, each referencing at least one stock in S. These historical prices incorporate the opening, highest, lowest, closing prices and adjusted closing price7 for each stock. Using P to signify the adjusted closing price of stock s on day t as P = {Ps,1, . . . , Pst}, we then express the actual labels for movement and volatility as follows: ˆyst m = 1(Pst − Ps,t−1), ˆyst v = 1(Pst − Ps,t−1)/Ps,t−1. (1) (2) We usually can generate multiple training examples by shifting the time lag within extensive historical stock data in practical situations. However, in order to simplify the expla- nation of our proposed method, we focus on a specific time lag for both movement and volatility prediction. We’ve also integrated the use of adjusted stock prices into our predictive models. [23]. This allows our models to learn from the genuine changes in a stock’s value that occur due to market conditions, rather than being swayed by artificial fluctuations resulting from corporate actions. IV. ECON STRUCTURE We present an overview of data ingestion, text preprocess- ing, and model architecture, as illustrated in Figure 1. Initially, we process the historical stock prices and macroeconomic factors to distill pertinent features. Following this, we sift through Twitter data to identify tweets that most aptly reflect public sentiment. During text preprocessing, we mask stock tickers associated with companies found in the curated tweets. These masked tweets are then transformed into embeddings. Leveraging a self-aware mechanism, we generate embeddings for both sectors and tweets. In the concluding step, we amal- gamate information from stocks, sectors, and macroeconomic indicators in a multi-trends approach to predict stock price movement and volatility. The crux of our problem lies in forecasting the binary move- ment and volatility of each stock’s price on day t, using the associated features and tweets within the lagged timeframe [t − d, t − 1], where d represents a predefined window size. 7The adjusted closing price amends a stock’s closing price to reflect that stock’s value after accounting for any corporate actions. A. Data Ingest Yahoo Finance. Yahoo Finance is a comprehensive finan- cial news and data platform providing stock market informa- tion, financial reports, and investment resources. We obtained historical data from Yahoo Finance, tracking the performance of 42 blue-chip stocks from June 1, 2020, to June 1, 2023. To streamline our prediction targets, we set a threshold range from -0.5% to 0.5% to exclude minor fluctuations, as in recent works for stock movement prediction [4], [9]. According to Baker et al. [24], daily stock price changes above 2.5% are often considered significant. However, our model is designed to predict unusual volatility. Therefore, in line with Ding et al.’s [25] explanation on special stock fluctuation constraints, we’ve set a higher benchmark, identifying a 5% fluctuation as an abnormal change. Consequently, we label samples with fluctuation percentages less than 5% as 0 and those equal to or more than 5% as 1. Google Trends. Google Trends is a tool offered by Google, providing users with a normalized count of total searches for specific terms within a given period. In this system, the volume of searches is benchmarked against a normalized scale, where 100 represents the peak search interest and 0 the lowest. For our study, we sourced our search data from web searches. Drawing inspiration from Wikipedia’s ”Outline of economics” page [26], we curated and refined our keyword list based on expert knowledge. Given the weekly granularity of our data, we partitioned our data retrieval into distinct time windows. We then normalized the search volumes within each window against each other, ensuring consistent normalization over the entire three-year span. This approach allowed us to seamlessly extract macroeconomic-specific trends by querying the chosen keywords. Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED). The FRED database, overseen by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, contains over 816,000 economic time series from diverse sources, encompassing sectors like banking, employment, GDP, and more. Many of these series are gathered from gov- ernment entities like the U.S. Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For our study, we used the same macroeconomic keywords as in Google Trends, aiming to capture insights from both societal and official viewpoints. Twitter. Twitter is a social media platform where users share and interact with brief messages called “tweets”. During the same date range with Yahoo
