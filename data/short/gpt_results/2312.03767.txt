to co-train a dual-branch teacher-student framework to split the target domain into known and unknown class subsets, proposes the Jensen-Shannon distance between the target pseudolabels and teacher model predictions as an effective criterion for separating target samples in known and unknown classes, conducts co-training, as well as a triplet loss for learning the decision boundary between known and unknown classes, utilizes curriculum guidance to balance adaptation of the target model to the known and unknown subsets, and minimizes the information maximization (IM) loss to encourage individually precise and globally diverse predictions. The paper introduces an Unknown Sample Discovery (USD) as a source-free Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) method that utilizes an ensemble-based pseudolabeling strategy for the target data and generates known and unknown target subsets based on Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD). The proposed method is demonstrated to be superior to existing source-free OSDA methods through extensive experiments on popular UDA benchmarks.
