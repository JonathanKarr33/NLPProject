The paper introduces the Multi-scale and Multi-modal Biomedical Time Series Contrastive Learning (MBSL) network to extract multi-scale patterns and useful representations from multi-modal biomedical time series data. The MBSL network includes three main parts: inter-modal grouping technique to address distribution gap across modalities, lightweight multi-scale data transformation using multi-scale patching and multi-scale masking, and cross-modal contrastive learning. Experimental results show that the MBSL outperforms state-of-the-art methods across four datasets in tasks including regression and classification. The paper also includes an in-depth description of the method and its experimental results.
