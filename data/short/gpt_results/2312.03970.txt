This paper introduces a Medical-Adapted and Knowledge-Enhanced Network (MAKEN) for medical report generation (MRG), which aims to describe medical images accurately and professionally. The MAKEN model combines medical vision foundational models and large language models with efficient design of task-specific components to address challenges in MRG. The model includes an adapter tuning module for the vision foundational model and a medical knowledge enhancement loss to reinforce the assimilation of medical terms. The MAKEN model is validated on the ImageCLEFmedical 2023 dataset and outperforms strong competitors in BERTScore, BLEU-1, ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L, METEOR, CIDEr, BLEURT, and CLIPScore. Ablation study shows that both adapter tuning and medical knowledge enhancement contribute to the model's performance. Overall, the proposed MAKEN model effectively addresses challenges in medical report generation and generates accurate and comprehensive medical descriptions from images.
