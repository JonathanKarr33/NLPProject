This paper describes the effort to revitalize Calvin and Hobbes comics using advanced machine learning techniques. The authors used stable diffusion fine-tuning to strike a balance between preserving the original artwork's essence and infusing it with contemporary flair. They prepared a dataset of black and white comic strips, extracted panels, and added text captions. Fine-tuning involved using LoRA and CLIP for training the diffusion model. The paper presents experimental results of generating images, videos, and using edge maps as input. The authors also discuss potential future work in improving the dataset and training mechanisms. All authors contributed to the project, and they acknowledge the Texas Advanced Computing Center for providing resources.
