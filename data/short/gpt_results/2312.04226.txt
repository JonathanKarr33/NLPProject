Blockchain technology has gained widespread popularity and is being utilized in various non-financial applications for its transparency, security, and decentralization. Two main types of blockchain exist, public and private, with consortium being a hybrid of the two. Private blockchain systems are easier to control dynamically as participating nodes communicate through a peer-to-peer network and hold personal ledgers storing transactions. Consensus protocols are used to validate and order transactions. However, scalability and high latency have limited adoption, and the trilemma trade-off between decentralization, scalability, and security poses a challenge. Dynamic management of blockchain systems is needed, and the paper proposes leveraging Digital Twins and DDDAS feedback loop for this purpose. A reinforcement learning agent combined with simulation is proposed as an approach to optimize the trilemma. Experimental results showed that the proposed approach improved the performance of the agent and was more efficient in terms of computational overhead.
