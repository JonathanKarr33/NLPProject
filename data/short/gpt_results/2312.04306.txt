This paper introduces the nerblackbox framework, which aims to simplify the usage of state-of-the-art named entity recognition (NER) models. The framework provides easy access to datasets, model training, evaluation, and inference, with a focus on hiding technical complexities from the user. It offers features such as dataset integration, automated training and evaluation, and simple model inference. The paper also discusses advanced usage, detailing features such as training hyperparameters and presets, dataset pruning, annotation schemes, multiple runs, detailed results, careful evaluation, and compatibility with transformers. The framework is designed to be versatile and customizable while still remaining user-friendly. The paper also highlights its resources, code quality, and acknowledgments for its support.
