The paper introduces the Multimodal Infant Model (MIMo) as an open source software platform for modeling human cognitive development and building developmental AI. The platform simulates interactions with the physical environment and features different sensory modalities and facial expressions. It discusses the challenges and advantages of using humanoid robots versus in silico simulations for such modeling. The paper also describes MIMo's physical design, actuation models, muscle compliance, and action cost functions. It emphasizes the importance of recreating the physical interaction with the environment for understanding cognitive development and achieving human-like intelligence in AI. The paper concludes with related work and implementations, including examples of MIMo learning tasks.
