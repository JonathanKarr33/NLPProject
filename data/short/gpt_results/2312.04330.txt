This paper introduces a deep learning approach called LANE-SI for long-term predictive modeling of sea ice concentration in the Arctic. The paper discusses the limitations of physical modeling and the need for lightweight surrogate models for sea ice forecasting. LANE-SI uses an ensemble of convolutional neural networks and satellite data to provide accurate predictions of sea ice concentration. The paper compares the performance of LANE-SI with physics-based models and demonstrates its effectiveness in reproducing ice concentration values and spatial distribution. The proposed method is flexible and computationally efficient, making it a valuable tool for environmental forecasting. Overall, LANE-SI offers a more lightweight and accurate alternative to existing solutions for sea ice forecasting.
