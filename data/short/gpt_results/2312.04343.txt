This paper discusses the negative impact of conventional pest management on climate change and public health. It proposes an AI-driven framework for integrated pest management (IPM) that provides short and long-term advice using data analysis and causal learning. The framework aims to promote sustainable practices, control pests, and enhance trust and transparency. The paper also highlights the importance of observational causal inference in evaluating the effectiveness of the framework. Additionally, the authors acknowledge funding from various sources for their research.
