This paper introduces the PCoQA dataset, a Persian Conversational Question Answering dataset designed to understand context-dependent and evolving conversations in question answering systems. The dataset contains 870 dialogs, 9,026 question-answer pairs, and corresponding documents retrieved from Wikipedia. The paper describes the construction process of the dataset, including document selection, data annotation, post-processing, dataset validation, analysis, and splitting. The dataset is also used to compare various models and experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of pre-training models on boosting performance. The results show that pre-training on ParSQuAD and QuAC can improve the model's performance, especially in capturing conversational information. Overall, the paper highlights the importance of understanding conversational context and the potential benefits of pre-training question-answering models.
