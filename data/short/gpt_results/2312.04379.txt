1]. This paper introduces a user-centered approach to eXplainable AI (XAI) and aims to assess the goodness of XAI systems by measuring their information power during human-AI decision-making tasks. The authors propose an assessment task to objectively and quantitatively measure the goodness of XAI systems and study the effectiveness of user-centered XAI in human-robot interaction scenarios. The task involves a decision-making task in a simulated environment, where users interact with an expert AI and a humanoid robot using a control panel. The paper also discusses the characteristics of the task, the simulated environment, and the robot's AI and XAI. The authors emphasize the need for objective and quantitative measures to assess the goodness of XAI techniques and propose a method to measure the information power of XAI models. The paper concludes with a discussion of the experimental hypotheses and the methods used for the assessment task.
