This paper introduces the Adversarial Denoising Diffusion Model (ADDM), an end-to-end unsupervised anomaly detection (AD) method using a diffusion model. The paper emphasizes the superior data sampling capability of diffusion models and proposes ADDM as a cost-efficient alternative with improved quality of denoised data. The paper provides an in-depth explanation of the methodology of diffusion models and the proposed ADDM, as well as experimental results with MRI images for brain tumor detection, demonstrating ADDM's 6.2% better performance compared to other diffusion model-based methods. The results indicate that ADDM outperforms existing state-of-the-art AD methods and is more cost-efficient in terms of computational resources. The proposed adversarial loss in ADDM is shown to improve AD performance and outperforms existing SOTA AD detection methods on MRI images.
