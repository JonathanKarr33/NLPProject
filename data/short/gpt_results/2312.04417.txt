 proposed by researchers from the AAAI Executive Council, focusing on the multiwinner voting rule during annual elections, where a third of the positions are up for election each time. The paper outlines the representation of the council from various subfields and geographical regions and the importance of gender and academic seniority diversity. It highlights the need for multiwinner voting rules that provide fair representation guarantees, with considerations for groups of voters not assured permanent representation. The paper also delves into the relevance of temporal multiwinner voting in various domains and proposes a unified framework to facilitate a principled study of temporal fairness. It discusses various components of the framework, including outcomes, structure, feasibility constraints, preferences, observability, sequentiality, and solution concepts. The study aims to set the groundwork for a more coherent and targeted approach to tackling conceptual and algorithmic challenges in temporal multiwinner voting.
