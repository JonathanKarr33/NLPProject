 25 ] : Y-Net is a state-of-the-art work for pedestrian trajectory prediction that uses a combination of LSTM and CNN layers to capture spatio-temporal dependencies in pedestrian trajectories . b ) Evaluation Metrics : We evaluate the performance of our model and the baselines using three standard metrics in trajectory prediction tasks - Average Displacement Error (ADE) , Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Multi- Modality Metrics (MM) . ADE and FDE measure the average and the final errors between the ground truth trajectory and the predicted trajectory respectively . MM measures the ability of the model to generate diverse predictions by computing the entropy of the predicted trajectories . V. CONCLUSION In this paper , we propose a novel model architecture for predicting spatio-temporal pedestrian trajectories in urban environments . Our model uses a combination of Graph Attention Networks , Transformers and a Generative CVAE-Residual-GMM Module to accurately capture social and environmental interactions and generate multi-modal predictions for pedestrian trajectories . We evaluated our model on three benchmark datasets and compared its performance with state-of-the-art baselines . The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the baselines in terms of trajectory prediction accuracy and multi-modality metrics . We believe that our model has the potential to significantly improve the safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles in urban environments .
