Introduction

that

Language models
encompass
(LMs)
transformer-based architectures (Brown et al.,
2020; Chowdhery et al., 2023; OpenAI, 2023) can
generate coherent and contextually relevant texts
for various use cases. Despite their impressive
performance, these models occasionally produce
erroneous or overconfident outputs, leading to
concerns about their calibration (Dawid, 1982;
DeGroot and Fienberg, 1983) which measures how
faithful a model‚Äôs prediction uncertainty is. Such a
problem is pressing as users adapt them using a
recent paradigm called in-context learning (Brown
et al., 2020) to construct performant predictors,
in safety-critical
especially for applications
domains (Bhatt et al., 2021; Kadavath et al., 2022;
Pan et al., 2023).

We provide an in-depth evaluation and analysis

of how well these models are calibrated - that is,
the alignment between the model‚Äôs confidence in
its predictions and the actual correctness of those
predictions. This token-level calibration assess-
ment will enable us to measure the discrepancy
between the model‚Äôs perceived and actual perfor-
mance through a Bayesian uncertainty lens, pro-
viding a valuable metric for assessing the model‚Äôs
accuracy and reliability.

We find that LMs including GPT-2 (Radford
et al., 2019) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a)
are poorly calibrated and there exists a calibration-
accuracy trade-off (Fig.1), i.e. as we increase the
amount of in-context samples, the prediction ac-
curacy and calibration error both increase. Cru-
cially, this calibration degradation worsens as the
model size increases or when fine-tuning occurs
using specialized data, such as curated instructions
(Dubois et al., 2023), dialogues (Zheng et al., 2023),
or human preference data (Ziegler et al., 2019).
Though previous work (Braverman et al., 2020)
shows the entropy of each generation step is drift-
ing and can be recalibrated via scaling techniques
(Platt et al., 1999) such as temperature scaling (Guo
et al., 2017), we show that the miscalibration issue
in ICL can not be easily addressed using such well-
established recalibration approaches that rely on
additional validation data.

Moreover, we study the trade-off in reasoning
tasks that involve the generation of explanations
(Camburu et al., 2018; Nye et al., 2021; Wei et al.,
2022) before the answer, showing that the model
can produce confidently wrong answers (using
confidence histograms and reliability plots) when
prompted with explanations on Strategy QA (Geva
et al., 2021), Commonsense QA (Talmor et al.,
2018), OpenBook QA (Mihaylov et al., 2018),
World Tree (Jansen et al., 2018). We carefully
design our human assessment to observe that, with
the increase in model sizes and the quantity of ICL
examples, there is a corresponding rise in the pro-

portion of confidently predicted examples among
those incorrectly forecasted. Moreover, we find
that a high proportion of wrong predictions are of
high confidence and showcase those typical confi-
dently wrong examples of LLMs.

In-context learning has been expected to learn
models by gradient descent in their forward pass
(Von Oswald et al., 2023), which might hopefully
yield calibrated predictions (B≈Çasiok et al., 2023)
if the models are getting close to local optimality
with respect to test loss through meta-optimization.
However, the fact that choosing ICL samples from
the validation set does not naturally lead to cali-
brated predictions shows that ICL learns in a fairly
different way than SGD. We design controlled ex-
periments to illustrate task learning properties of
ICL, showing that when examples in the prompt
demonstrate consistent task properties, the learning
performance, and calibration would be improved.

Uncertainty quantification in NLP. Uncertainty
quantification in NLP, which often adopts the
Bayesian principle to sophisticated methods tai-
lored for neural networks, aims to enhance the re-
liability of model predictions. This may involve
non-trivial designs as directly interpreting language
model predictions via probabilities (Kadavath et al.,
2022) and linguistic expressions (Lin et al., 2022;
Mielke et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2023) may in-
advertently lead to over-reliance on the model‚Äôs
uncertainties (Si et al., 2023), thus complicating
the establishment of trustworthy common ground
between humans and models (Bu√ßinca et al., 2021).
Notable recent advancements include employing
model confidence as a critical factor in various ap-
plications like dialogue generation (Mielke et al.,

2022), cascading prediction (Schuster et al., 2021),
open-domain QA (Fisch et al., 2020; Angelopoulos
et al., 2022), summarization (Laban et al., 2022),
language modeling (Schuster et al., 2022), image
captioning (Petryk et al., 2023).

Calibration of LLMs. Calibration is a safety
property to measure the faithfulness of machine
learning models‚Äô uncertainty, especially for error-
prone tasks using LLMs. Previous works find that
pre-training (Desai and Durrett, 2020) and explana-
tion (Zhang et al., 2020; Gonz√°lez et al., 2021) im-
proves calibration. Models can be very poorly cali-
brated when we prompt LMs (Jiang et al., 2021),
while calibration can also depend on model size
(Kadavath et al., 2022). (Braverman et al., 2020)
assesses the long-term dependencies in a language
model‚Äôs generations compared to those of the un-
derlying language and finds that entropy drifts as
models such as GPT-2 generate text. The intricacy
of explanations on complementary team perfor-
mance poses additional challenges due to the over-
reliance on explanations of users regardless of their
correctness (Bansal et al., 2021). (Mielke et al.,
2022) gives a framework for linguistic calibra-
tion, a concept that emphasizes the alignment of a
model‚Äôs expressed confidence or doubt with the ac-
tual accuracy of its responses. The process involves
annotating generations with <DK>, <LO>, <HI>
for confidence levels, then training the confidence-
controlled model by appending the control token
<DK/LO/HI> at the start of the output, followed
by training a calibrator to predict these confidence
levels, and finally predicting confidence when gen-
erating new examples. (Tian et al., 2023) finds that
asking LLMs for their probabilities can be better
than using conditional probabilities in a traditional
way. (Shih et al., 2023) proposes a simple amor-

pling from LMs and diffusion models. To enhance
the estimation of uncertainty in language models,
(Kuhn et al., 2023) developed a method that aggre-
gates log probabilities across semantically equiva-
lent outputs. This approach utilizes bidirectional
entailment through a model to identify outputs that
are semantically similar, thereby refining the un-
certainty estimation process. (Cole et al., 2023)
identifies the calibration challenge in ambiguous
QA and distinguishes uncertainty about the answer
(epistemic uncertainty) from uncertainty about the
meaning of the question (denotational uncertainty),
proposing sampling and self-verification methods.
(Kamath et al., 2020) trains a calibrator to iden-
tify inputs on which the QA model errs and ab-
stains when it predicts an error is likely. (Zhao
et al., 2023) proposes the Pareto optimal learning
assessed risk score for calibration and error cor-
rection but requires additional training. (Kalai and
Vempala, 2023) shows the trade-off between cal-
ibration and hallucination but they didn‚Äôt study it
in an ICL setting and how the predicted answer‚Äôs
accuracy would impact those two safety aspects.

Setting. Given a pre-trained language model
PŒ∏(wt|w<t), we seek to adapt it using the prompt
w0 = [x1, y1, x2, y2, . . . , xn‚àí1, yn‚àí1, xn]
to
generate a predicted answer yn = PŒ∏(w0).
In
the context of reasoning, a popular approach is

test sample:

(cid:122)
(cid:123)
w1, w2, . . . , wk, yn = PŒ∏(w0).

We extract token-level answer probabilities of
LLMs,1 e.g. for binary classification tasks, we filter
and extract probabilities P (‚ÄúYes‚Äù) and P (‚ÄúNo‚Äù),
based on which we calculate the following statistics
for studying the confidence and calibration of LMs:
Confidence and feature norm. We record the
maximum probability of the answer token as its
confidence Conf = PŒ∏(yn|w<n) and the feature
norm zn as the hidden states of the answer token
from the output of the last layer of the model.
Entropy rate. We denote the entropy of
a token wt at position t as H(wt|w<t) =

1We also normalize the probability PŒ∏ (yn | w<n) ‚àà ‚àÜK

for classification problems with K choices

‚àíEwt‚àºPŒ∏(¬∑|w<t)[log PŒ∏(wt|w<t)]. We typically
measure it based on the answer token via setting
wt = yn. Note that auto-regressive LLMs are
trained via maximizing the negative log-likelihood
objective L = ‚àíEt[log PŒ∏ (wt|w<t)] on massive
corpora.
Empirical estimate of the expected calibration
error (ECE) In the realm of probabilistic classi-
fiers, calibration is a crucial concept. A classifier,
denoted as PŒ∏ with parameters Œ∏ and operating over
C classes, is said to be "canonically calibrated"
when, for every probability distribution p over the
C classes and for every label y, the probability that
the label is y given the classifier‚Äôs prediction is p
matches the component of p corresponding to y.
This is mathematically represented as:

‚àÄp ‚àà ‚àÜC‚àí1, ‚àÄy ‚àà Y : P (Y = y | PŒ∏(X) = p) = py.
(1)
Here, ‚àÜC‚àí1 symbolizes the (C ‚àí 1)-dimensional
simplex, which encompasses all potential probabil-
ity distributions over the C classes.

A simpler calibration criterion is the "top-label
calibration." In this case, a classifier is deemed cali-
brated if, for every top predicted probability p‚àó, the
probability that the true label belongs to the class
with the highest predicted probability, given that
this maximum predicted probability is p‚àó, equals
p‚àó. Formally:

‚àÄp‚àó ‚àà [0, 1] : P (Y ‚àà arg max p | max PŒ∏(X) = p‚àó) = p‚àó.
(2)
To gauge the calibration of a model, we adopt

Expected Calibration Error (ECE) defined as:

E [|p‚àó ‚àí E [Y ‚àà arg max PŒ∏(X) | max PŒ∏(X) = p‚àó]|] .
(3)
In real-world applications, this quantity cannot
be computed without quantization. So, the ECE is
approximated by segmenting predicted confidences
into M distinct bins, B1, . . . , BM . The approxima-
tion is then computed as:

(cid:91)ECE =

|acc (Bm) ‚àí conf (Bm)| .

Here, acc (Bm) is the accuracy within bin Bm,
and conf (Bm) is the average confidence of pre-
dictions in bin Bm. The total number of samples
is represented by n, and the dataset consists of n

4 Experimental Results

4.1 Experimental Settings

Models. We study decoder-only autoregressive
LMs involving GPT-2, LLaMA (Touvron et al.,
2023a), and their variants fine-tuned with instruc-
tion, dialog, or RLHF like Alpaca (Dubois et al.,
2023), Vicuna (Zheng et al., 2023), and LLaMA2-
Chat (Touvron et al., 2023b).

Datasets and tasks. We used both traditional
NLU tasks such as AGNews (Zhang et al., 2015),
TREC (Voorhees and Tice, 2000), CB (Schick and
Sch√ºtze, 2021), SST-2 (Socher et al., 2013), DBPe-
dia (Zhang et al., 2015), as well as reasoning ques-
tion answering tasks like Strategy QA (Geva et al.,
2021), Commonsense QA (Talmor et al., 2018),
OpenBook QA (Mihaylov et al., 2018), World Tree

(Jansen et al., 2018). Notably, the reasoning task
performance can be greatly improved in general
via prompting methods like scratchpad (Nye et al.,
2021; Wei et al., 2022) that enables models to gen-
erate natural language explanations before predict-
ing an answer.

In-context learning settings. We prompt the
model via sampling k examples from the training
set for each test example in the k-shot setting. Each
experiment is repeated 10 times to reduce variance
and we report the mean results. We use M = 10
bins for calculating calibration errors.

4.2 Numerical Results

The performance of LLaMA. We seek to char-
acterize the calibration-accuracy trade-off in both
simple and realistic settings (Tab. 1). We record
the performance and calibration errors in both mis-
calibrated and recalibrated settings. Moreover, we
take a close look at the prompting approaches that
explicitly include explanations in reasoning tasks

thought (Wei et al., 2022), showing that the cali-
bration degrades after generating a long context for
reasoning and explaining the final answer.

The effect of temperature scaling. We experi-
ment with three strategies in applying temperature
scaling methods (Guo et al., 2017) to fix miscali-
bration:

1. We learn one temperature for each n-shot ICL,
i.e., we learn different temperatures for differ-
ent shot numbers in ICL;

2. Learn a temperature from the training split
(zero-shot) and apply it to all test samples
with different shot numbers;

3. For each experiment, we fix the prompt and
learn the temperature for the fixed prompt.
That is, for every possible ICL prompt, we
learn a corresponding temperature for calibra-
tion.

Looking into Fig. 6, none of the above strate-
gies achieves satisfactory calibration performance,
which is in contrast to the well-studied super-
vised learning setting where scaling the confidence
scores (via temperature scaling) can effectively re-
duce calibration errors (Guo et al., 2017). The fact
that applying a post-processing calibration method,
such as temperature scaling, as used in most previ-
ous work, cannot directly resolve the miscalibration
issue suggests that ICL might have substantially
different properties compared to making predic-
tions via classical supervised learning models, thus
future investigations are needed to address such
miscalibration issues.

The effect of finetuning. We show that vicuna
and alpaca are both more accurate but less cali-
brated than their LLaMA counterpart backbones,
the margin is especially large for reasoning tasks
and vicuna. Thus we compare those models‚Äô accu-
racy and ECE in Fig. 3, showing that finetuning
might significantly degrade calibration, corrobo-
rating the evidence shown in (OpenAI, 2023), al-
beit it can improve the reasoning accuracy dramati-
cally. Our results provide evidence that though fine-
tuned on carefully curated datasets can greatly im-
prove question-answering performance, especially
for hard tasks like reasoning problems, attention
may need to be paid when assessing the calibration
of those models‚Äô predictions.

The accuracy is high for 0-shot ICL but has not
increased much as we include more in-context ex-
amples. We also note that the pattern of zero-shot
performance is totally different for two fine-tuned
models, i.e. vicuna, and alpaca.

The effect of prompt repetition.
In our study
investigating the impact of various prompt strate-
gies, we employ three distinct approaches: Repeat-
context: In this strategy, we construct the prompt
as w0 = [x1, x1, ..., x1, y1], where we repetitively
include only the context x1 a total of n times,
excluding the label y1 from repetition. Repeat-
prompt: Here, we shape the prompt as w0 =
[x1, y1, ..., x1, y1], repeating both the context x1
and the label y1 n times within the prompt. Normal:
In this strategy, we construct the prompt as w0 =
[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn‚àí1, yn‚àí1, xn, yn], where dis-
tinct context-label pairs are systematically chosen
to form the prompt. The results presented in Ta-
ble 3 unveil essential insights: (1) The inclusion of
labels within the prompt contributes to a reduction
in uncertainty and facilitates more effective rea-
soning. Conversely, merely repeating the context
without incorporating labels fails to yield improved
performance. (2) Notably, the diversity inherent in
the prompt‚Äôs construction significantly impacts per-
formance, particularly concerning larger language
models.

4.3 Qualitative Results

Reliability diagram and confidence histogram.
A reliability diagram is a graphical tool used to
evaluate the calibration of probabilistic predictions
of a model across multiple classes; it compares
the predicted probabilities of each class against
the actual outcomes, with a perfectly calibrated
model having its values lie on the diagonal y = x
line. A confidence histogram, on the other hand,
displays the distribution of the model‚Äôs prediction
confidences across all classes, showing how often
the model predicts certain probabilities.

We showcase that in SST-2 (4-shot), showing
that both ACC and ECE of LLaMA increase as the
model size increases (Fig. 2). We can observe that
confidence scores tend to concentrate on values
above 0.8 as we enlarge model sizes.

4.4 Ablation Studies

For case studies, we research how miscalibration
can impact the selective classification of LLMs,
where models are supposed to abstain from uncer-

Ablation with model sizes. As we enlarge the sizes
of models, they will become more confident and
accurate (Fig. 2). As a result, the entropy decreases
and ECE increases, showing that token-level cali-
bration might have an inverse scaling relationship
with model sizes.
A closer look at the hidden state and confidence
score. To better understand the miscalibration is-
sue of ICL, we conduct fined-grained experiments
to take a closer look at ICL properties: we measure
the norm of the representation vectors2 for differ-
ent number of shots in ICL, to better understand
how the representation vectors are changing when
increasing the number of shots in ICL. Meanwhile,
we also measure the confidence and entropy of the
prediction for yn, and the results are summarized
in Table 2. When switching from 0-shot to 1-shot,
all three measurements (representation norm, en-
tropy, and confidecent) drastically change. Mean-
while, more ICL samples lead to smaller entropy
and higher confidence in most cases.

ples of LLaMA and plot the distribution of wrongly
predicted samples and the confidence scores via
thresholding. Similar to previous observations, as
model sizes and the number of ICL examples scale
up, LMs would generate more confident samples
(Fig. 4 (c, d)). Note, that we observe "inverse
scaling" behaviors where models with larger sizes
are more error-prone and tend to generate more
confidently wrong samples (Fig, 5).
Examples of hallucinated explanations for
highly confident predictions. Next, we showcase
in Table 4 that models generate both wrong expla-
nations and incorrect predictions with high confi-
dence. We also observe that most of the wrong
predictions are highly confident. We manually ex-
amine the correctness of explanations on common-
sense QA, and found its high correlations with pre-
dicted answer accuracy, which is the opposite of
token-level explainability that tends to get worse
when the accuracy improves.

5 Discussion and Concluding Remarks

In our investigation of the token-level calibration
of in-context learning in contemporary Large Lan-
guage Models (LLMs), we have delineated the in-
tricate balance between ICL performance and cali-
bration. Our findings underscore the importance of

being circumspect in model deployment, as maxi-
mizing ICL performance does not invariably trans-
late to improved calibration. As LMs continue to
evolve and gain more capabilities such as having
long enough context windows that can include the
whole training set as in-context examples for some
downstream tasks, our result can be pedagogical
when users would like to examine their uncertainty
through prediction probabilities. Moreover, the
work suggests the following future directions:

Understanding the internal mechanism of ICL
for calibration.
In this work, we observe that ex-
isting scaling recalibration methods cannot fully re-
solve the miscalibration issues of ICL, so better un-
derstanding and mitigation strategies are needed. A
potential approach can be leveraging transparency
tools and studying whether predictable errors exist
during text generation.
Calibration beyond classification regimes. Our
findings indicate that in multi-choice or multi-class
classification tasks, even though the calibration of
answer tokens may deteriorate in high-performance
settings, there may be a positive correlation be-
tween accuracy and the correctness of explanations
in reasoning tasks. This suggests potential avenues
for future research such as exploring strategies such
as the use of hedging words to express uncertainty
and examining their relationship with predictive
performance.
