Introduction
Face recognition is one of the most challenging tasks in pat-
tern recognition and machine vision, and there are increasing
demands in many industry areas. Current SOTA face recog-
nition losses are mainly margin-based softmax losses (Liu
et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018b,a; Deng et al. 2019; Sun et al.
2020; Huang et al. 2020; Deng et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020;
Deng et al. 2021), which enforce greater intra-class com-
pactness and inter-class discrepancy by adding an extra mar-
gin. They help pull face features towards the learnable class
center with the same label to guide the label predicting. Ex-
cept for the great development in face recognition, face clus-
tering has made remarkable progress and can learn rich and
hierarchical semantic information from large-scale data. In-
tuitively, face clustering task (Lloyd 1982; Ester et al. 1996;
Wang et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2020a) may promote the clas-
sification task in traditional face recognition. To the best of
our knowledge, how to incorporate information from clus-
tering into the learning process of label prediction has been
little explored in academia.
Several works try to unify face recognition and face clus-
tering. For instance, FaceNet (Schroff, Kalenichenko, and
Philbin 2015) solves this by adopting the triplet metric loss

to pull the sample towards the positive anchor and push it
away from the negative anchor. However, FaceNet does not
optimize the classification task directly, while the current
state-of-the-art methodsâ€™ performances are achieved by clas-
sification. CenterLoss (Wen et al. 2016) jointly optimizes the
classification task by minimizing the Softmax loss and opti-
mizing the clustering task by reducing the distance between
the feature and its class center. However, CenterLoss con-
ducts the joint learning in a naive way and only considers
the intra-class compactness and ignores the inter-class dis-
crepancy. MagFace (Meng et al. 2021) points out that the
magnitude of the face feature can be regarded as the indica-
tor of face quality and can be used for face quality cluster-
ing. Furthermore, face quality can guide the label prediction
by adaptively adjusting the margin in the label classification
loss. However, face quality is not the only influence factor on
face recognition in real life scenarios and the hard samples
are mainly due to large variations in pose, age, and occlu-
sion. And these faces with large variations are usually harder
to cluster, hence we should also pay attention to these sam-
ples with large variations instead of merely considering face
Recently, contrastive learning has been employed in the
clustering task and performs well on various benchmarks (Li
et al. 2020, 2021). In this work, we try to explore the prob-
lem through the joint optimization task of face label pre-
diction and supervised contrastive face clustering. We try
to integrate the clustering information into the classic face
recognition from two aspects. The level of clustering con-
centration depicts the compactness of the cluster result (Li
et al. 2020). From the geometric perspective, faces tend to
be more easily pulled to the cluster center and more eas-
ily classified if the face cluster has a larger concentration.
Thus, in the first aspect, we extend the ArcFace loss func-
tion with a cluster-guided angular margin to adaptively tune
the classification decision boundary according to the hard
level of clustering, and the loss is named as Cluster-Guided
ArcFace(CG-ArcFace). In a nutshell, the class with a larger
concentration should be assigned with a smaller angular
margin, and the class with a smaller concentration should
be assigned with a larger angular margin. In this way, we
can utilize the clustering information to facilitate the classi-
fication in an explicit manner compared with FaceNet and
CenterLoss. In the other aspect, to further use face cluster-
ing to promote face recognition, we propose a supervised
contrastive face clustering approach and a cluster-aligning
procedure to jointly optimize both clustering and recogni-
tion tasks, which jointly considers the intra-class compact-
ness and inter-class discrepancy. The optimization of clus-
tering helps the feature extractor to learn the prototype of
each class at the feature level explicitly, which helps to im-
prove the robustness of the feature extractor to hard samples
with large variations in pose, age, occlusion, etc. Compared
with the MagFace, we add an explicit clustering learning
process to pull faces with different variations towards the
cluster center.
In summary, the contributions of this work are:
â€¢ We extend ArcFace with a cluster-guided angular margin
to adjust the within-class feature distribution based on the
cluster concentration, which injects the cluster knowl-
edge to label classification for joint learning.
â€¢ We further propose to jointly optimize both clustering
and recognition tasks via a supervised contrastive face
clustering approach and an additional cluster-aligning
â€¢ Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on popu-
lar facial benchmarks prove the effectiveness of our ap-
proach and the superiority over the existing methods to
face recognition.

Face Recognition
The current face recognition approaches can be divided
into metric-learning methods and classification meth-
ods. In the metric-learning approaches, FaceNet (Schroff,
Kalenichenko, and Philbin 2015) minimizes the distance be-
tween the anchor and positive samples and maximizes the
distance between the anchor and negative samples. Cen-
terLoss (Wen et al. 2016) minimizes the Euclidean dis-
tance between the face feature and its class center. In the
classification category, the typical loss functions include
SphereFace (Liu et al. 2017), CosFace (Wang et al. 2018b),
ArcFace (Deng et al. 2019) and so on. They enforce bet-
ter intra-class compactness and inter-class discrepancy by
adding an extra margin. They help pull face instances to-
wards the learnable class center with the same identity, re-
sulting in a discriminative face representation. Since a fixed
margin in the margin-based loss leads the network to treat
each sample equally without considering their importance
degree, mining-based strategies are adopted to pay more at-
tention to hard samples. MV-Softmax (Wang et al. 2020) and
CurricularFace (Huang et al. 2020) define hard samples as
misclassified samples and integrate margin and mining into
one framework. They emphasize hard samples by adopting a
preset constant (MV-Softmax) or an adaptive variable (Cur-
ricularFace) as the weights of negative cosine similarities.
Besides, AdaptiveFace (Liu et al. 2019b), AdaCos (Zhang
et al. 2019) and FairLoss (Liu et al. 2019a) utilize adaptive
margin strategy to automatically tune hyperparameters dur-
ing training. MagFace (Meng et al. 2021) is a joint frame-
work of face recognition and clustering based on face qual-
ity. The feature magnitude is used as the quality indicator,
and the adaptive margin and regularization item help enforce
the face with higher quality to have a larger magnitude.
Face Clustering
The works in face clustering can be divided into two cate-
gories. Although promising results have been achieved, clas-
sic unsupervised clustering gives discouraging results on
large-scale complex datasets due to the naive distribution
assumptions (Lloyd 1982; Ester et al. 1996). Hence, some
supervised methods based on the graph convolutional net-
work (GCN) have been proposed recently. For instance, L-
GCN (Wang et al. 2019) predicts the linkage on subgraphs
deploying a GCN. DS-GCN (Yang et al. 2019) and VE-
GCN (Yang et al. 2020b) utilize two-stage GCNs to cluster
the faces. STAR-FC (Shen et al. 2021) proposes a structure-
preserved sampling strategy to train the edge classification
In our method, we try to cluster the faces in a supervised
contrastive learning way, motivated by the works (Khosla
et al. 2020; Li et al. 2020). Instead of developing cluster-
ing methods, our approach aims at improving feature dis-
tribution structure and providing the input feature for the
mainstream clustering methods, which is similar to the Mag-
Face (Meng et al. 2021).
Proposed Approach
Figure 1 demonstrates the overall framework of our ap-
proach. The framework contains an encoder which is opti-
mized by backpropagation and parameterized by Î¸f , and an
momentum encoder parameterized by Î¸m and updated by
momentum: Î¸m â† meÎ¸m + (1 âˆ’ me)Î¸f (He et al. 2020).
me is the momentum to control the updating speed of pa-
rameters. The momentum encoder generates face features to
dynamically maintain a Feature Queue Q. We cluster face
features according to the labels within the Q. We denote the
class number as K and the class set of training dataset is
denoted as K = {1, 2, ..., K}. The feature set of class k in
Q is denoted as Qk, and the cluster center of class k within
used for updating the cluster center of class k in the Cluster-
Center Bank, which is denoted as Ck. The updating process
is Ck â† mcCk + (1 âˆ’ mc)C q
k, where mc is the momentum
controlling the updating speed.
k is calculated by C q
Given the current Q and the updated Cluster-Center Bank,
we can calculate and update the concentration level for each
class. Referring the work (Li et al. 2020), the concentration
is measured by the Equation 1, where a smaller Ï• indicates
larger concentration. Î± is a smooth parameter to ensure
that small clusters do not have an overly-large Ï•.
âˆ¥f âˆ’ Ckâˆ¥2
|Qk|log (|Qk| + Î±)
, k âˆˆ K = {1, 2, ..., K}
In the above way, we can obtain each classâ€™s cluster center
and corresponding cluster concentration. Then we sample
M classes among all the K classes, and the sampled cluster
centers and cluster concentrations are denoted as Î¦ and C re-
spectively. The Î¦ and C are involved in loss function design
Three loss functions are employed in our framework,
which are the Cluster-Guided ArcFace loss LCGâˆ’ArcF ace,
the supervised Cluster Contrastive loss LCluâˆ’Con and the
Cluster Aligning loss LCluâˆ’Ali.
proves face recognition in the wild. Hence, we reformulate
the Equation 2 to derive the Cluster-Guided ArcFace loss.
The LCGâˆ’ArcF ace is formulated in Equation 3 and Equa-
Cluster-Guided ArcFace
Before introducing our proposed Cluster-Guided ArcFace
loss, we briefly revisit the ArcFace (Deng et al. 2019). We
suppose that we are given a training batch of B face samples
i=1, where fi âˆˆ Rd denotes the d-dimensional em-
bedding and yi is its associated class label. By defining the
angle Î¸j between fi and j-th learnable class center Wj âˆˆ Rd
j fi = âˆ¥Wjâˆ¥âˆ¥fiâˆ¥cosÎ¸j, the objective of ArcFace can
be formulated as Equation 2:
LArcF ace = âˆ’
esÂ·cos(Î¸yi +m)
esÂ·cos(Î¸yi +m) + (cid:80)
where m > 0 denotes the additive angular margin and s
is the scaling parameter.
Despite its superior performance in enforcing intra-class
compactness and inter-class discrepancy, ArcFace employs
the uniform margin m for each class without consider-
ing the feature distribution structure. Different from Mag-
Face (Meng et al. 2021) that utilizes the face quality to ad-
just the margin, we directly explore the clustering structure
knowledge and adjust the uniform margin based on the clus-
ter concentration. We suppose the class with a smaller con-
centration, i.e., larger Ï•, should be assigned with a larger
margin. From the perspective of clustering, the smaller con-
centration indicates that faces are harder to cluster, and there
are more hard samples in this class. Assigning the class of
smaller concentration with a larger margin will help pulling
the hard samples towards the learnable class center and im-
LCGâˆ’ArcF ace = âˆ’
esÂ·cos(Î¸yi +Î»(Ï•yi )Â·m)
esÂ·cos(Î¸yi +Î»(Ï•yi )Â·m) + (cid:80)
where Î»(Ï•yi) is a scale factor to multiply the uniform
margin m and has the property of monotonically increasing
with the Ï•yi and monotonically decreasing with the concen-
tration. Hence, if the class yi has smaller concentration, a
larger margin Î»(Ï•yi) Â· m should be assigned to it.
We can define Î»(Ï•yi) in a linear manner. We denote
the maximum concentration of all classes as Ï•max =
max{Ï•k, k âˆˆ K} and the minimum concentration as
Ï•min = min{Ï•k, k âˆˆ K}. Then Î»(Ï•yi) is defined as Equa-
Î»(Ï•yi ) =
Ï•yi âˆ’ Ï•min
Ï•max âˆ’ Ï•min
Supervised Contrastive Clustering
Except for adjusting the classification margin based on the
cluster concentration, which is a manner of joint learning
of classification and clustering, we furthermore propose to
jointly optimize both tasks via a supervised contrastive clus-
tering process and an additional clustering-aligning process.
We employ the infoNCE (van den Oord, Li, and Vinyals
2018) loss to conduct contrastive learning of the instance
features and cluster centers, named as supervised Cluster
Contrastive loss, LCluâˆ’Con. Given an instance feature, we
can obtain the positive cluster center according to its label
and obtain some other cluster centers as negative samples.
We regard it as a supervised contrastive manner because we
extend the traditional self-supervised batch contrastive ap-
proach to the fully-supervised setting with reference to Sup-
Con (Khosla et al. 2020).
Assuming that the input mini-batch contains B sam-
ples and the number of sampled cluster centers is M ,
we denote the features and class labels of the mini-
batch as F = [f1, f2, ..., fB] and [y1, y2, ..., yB] , yi âˆˆ
K. The sampled cluster centers are denoted as C =
2 , ..., C s
M ], and their labels and concentration mea-
surements are [ys
M ] and Î¦ = [Ï•s
2, ..., Ï•s
Then the supervised Cluster Contrastive loss is defined as
Equation 6, where 1 (cid:0)yi = ys
(cid:1) = 1 if yi is the same as ys
otherwise 1 (cid:0)yi = ys
(cid:1) = 0.
LCluâˆ’Con = âˆ’
j=1 exp (cid:0)fi Â· C s
j=1 exp (cid:0)fi Â· C s
(cid:1) 1 (cid:0)yi = ys
The class-adaptive temperature Ï•s
j is designed with refer-
ence to PCL (Li et al. 2020). It helps make LCluâˆ’Con be
adaptive to samples with different hardness levels.
Major Differences from the Related Work The super-
vised Cluster Contrastive loss is designed with reference to
SupCon (Khosla et al. 2020) and PCL (Li et al. 2020). Sup-
Con first proposes to conduct contrastive learning in a su-
pervised way, and the positive sample is selected from the
images with the same class label. Our work inherits the idea
of supervised learning from SupCon, and the main differ-
ence is that we choose the cluster centers rather than images
to form positive and negative samples and adopt a class-
adaptive temperature for face clustering. PCL proposes to
utilize class prototypes to bridge contrastive learning and
clustering while the class prototypes in their work are gen-
erated using the Expectation-Maximization(EM)-based al-
gorithm, which is also an unsupervised learning way. The
main difference between our work and PCL is that our clus-
ter centers are generated in a supervised manner and make
full usage of the face labels.
In addition to the contrastive learning between cluster
centers and instances, we add an extra contrastive learn-
ing process between cluster centers and the learnable class
centers in the label classifier, and we employ the cluster-
aligning loss, LCluâˆ’Ali to implement it. LCluâˆ’Ali will help
align the cluster center Cyi and the corresponding learn-
able class center Wyi, and this may promote the classi-
fier optimization using the clustering results. We define the
LCluâˆ’Ali as Equation 7, where Ï„ is the learnable tempera-
ture widely used in contrastive learning.
LCluâˆ’Ali = âˆ’

j=1 exp (C s

Experiments
Implementation Details
We utilize the refined MS1M (Guo et al. 2016) as our
training dataset to conduct a fair comparison with other
methods. In the testing stage, we extensively evaluate our
approach on popular benchmarks, including LFW (Huang
et al. 2007), CFP-FP (Sengupta et al. 2016), CPLFW (Zheng
and Deng. 2018), AgeDB (Nech and Kemelmacher-
Shlizerman 2017), CALFW (Zheng and Deng. 2017), IJB-
B (Whitelam et al. 2017), IJB-C (Maze et al. 2018) and
MegaFace (Kemelmacher-Shlizerman et al. 2016). For data
pre-processing, we first resize the aligned face images to
112 Ã— 112. For the selection of backbone networks, we use
the most widely used CNN architectures ResNet (He et al.
2016). All experiments in this paper are implemented using
PyTorch, and we will release our code and pretrained models
in the near future.
The batch size B is set to 512, and models are trained on
8 NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs. We employ the Adam opti-
mizer in the training stage, and the learning rate starts from
0.001. We decrease the learning rate by 0.1Ã— at 20th, 40th,
and 60th epochs and stop at 80th epochs. The momentum
me for updating the momentum encoder is set to 0.999, and
the size of the Feature Queue Q is set to 8192. The mo-
mentum mc for updating the Cluster-Center Bank is set to
0.9. The number of the class centers, M in Equation 6 and
Equation 7, is 2048. The margin parameter m and the scale
parameter s in Equation 4 are 0.5 and 64. The smooth pa-
rameter in Equation 1 is set to 10. The loss weights Î»1 and
Î»2 are 1.0 and 0.5, respectively.
Comparison with the State-of-the-Art Methods
To compare with recent state-of-the-art competitors, we train
our model on the MS1M dataset, and the backbone we adopt
is ResNet-100 for a fair comparison. Our model is tested on
various benchmarks, including LFW for unconstrained face
verification, CFP-FP and CPLFW for large pose variations,
AgeDB and CALFW for age variations, IJB-B, and IJB-C
for mixed-media (image and video) face verification, and
MegaFace for identification and verification under million-
scale distractors. As is reported in Table 1, the proposed
method achieves the state-of-the-art result (99.85) with the
competitors on LFW, where the performance is almost sat-
urated. For pose-invariant and age-invariant face recogni-
tion, our method achieves 99.12% on CFP-FP, 93.51% on
CPLFW, 98.58% on AgeDB, and 96.16% on CALFW and
outperforms most of the other state-of-the-art methods, in-
cluding GroupFace, CurricularFace, Sub-center ArcFace,
BroadFace, VPL-ArcFace, ElasticFace and etc. Besides, our
model obtains 95.62 TAR on IJB-B and 96.80 TAR on IJB-
C when FAR is set as 1eâˆ’4 and achieves the best perfor-
mance on these two benchmarks. On MegaFace, our ap-
proach also has comparable results with the state-of-the-art
method(VPL-ArcFace). Overall speaking, the superiority of

Ablation Study
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness and performance
of our proposed method, we carried out sufficient abla-
tion experimental studies to explore the contributions of
the Cluster-Guided ArcFace LCGâˆ’ArcF ace, the supervised
Cluster Contrastive loss LCluâˆ’Con and the Cluster-Aligning
loss LCluâˆ’Ali. Since our proposed classification loss, the
Cluster-Guided ArcFace, is based on the original ArcFace
loss, we select the model with ArcFace classification head
and ResNet-100 backbone as the baseline model. The ab-
lation studies are divided into two parts, where one part ex-
plores the performance improvement of individual loss func-
tions, and the other one explores the joint performance im-
provement of multiple losses. The overall ablation studies
are demonstrated in Table 2.
Performance Improvement of Individual Losses Firstly,
we study the effect of each loss function on the baseline sep-
setting1: We replace the ArcFace loss with the proposed
Cluster-Guided ArcFace LCGâˆ’ArcF ace to utilize the clus-
ter concentration of each class to adjust the decision margin
adaptively. The setting1 model significantly outperforms the
baseline model on all the benchmarks except for the LFW
benchmark, where the performance is almost saturated. Es-
pecially, the setting1 model has a significant improvement
on the benchmarks with hard face samples, including CFP-
FP and CPLFW with large pose variations, AgeDB and
CALFW with age variations, IJB-B(C) containing images
and frames from videos, and the MegaFace containing mas-
sive samples and a high degree of variability in scale, pose
and occlusion. The hard samples with large variations in
pose, age, scale, and occlusion, are usually distributed far
away from the cluster center and are harder to cluster. We
assume that the margin for their class should be tuned larger
to help pulling the hard samples towards the learnable class
center. The comparisons between the setting1 and the base-
line have proved the correctness of our assumption and the
validity of the Cluster-Guided ArcFace.
setting2: We add the supervised Cluster Contrastive loss
LCluâˆ’Con to the baseline model to verify the effect of the
joint optimization of both clustering and recognition task.
From Table 2, the setting2 model notably exceeds the base-
line on all the benchmarks especially the benchmarks with
hard samples. We believe that the experimental results can
be interpreted as the optimization of clustering being able to
help the feature extractor learn the prototype of each class at
the feature level explicitly. However, in ArcFace, the concept
of the prototype is reflected through the classifier weights.
The joint optimization of clustering and recognition is, in
fact, a fusion of the two ideas of the learning prototype. Joint
learning of class prototypes helps to improve the robustness
of feature extraction of hard samples with large variations in
pose, age, scale, occlusion, etc.
setting3: We add the Cluster-Aligning loss LCluâˆ’Ali to
facilitate the learning of ArcFace in the setting3. There are
some improvements on different benchmarks, but the im-
provements are limited compared with the setting1 and set-
ting2. The Cluster-Aligning loss can enhance the perfor-
mance because the alignment between learnable class cen-
ters in the classifier and cluster centers helps the learning
of the classifier to be robust to the variations of faces. The
reason why the improvements are limited is that the Cluster-
Aligning loss serves a similar role as the ArcFace, and little
additional knowledge is learned.
Performance Improvement of Joint Combination of
Multiple Losses
In the above section, we have evaluated
the individual improvement of the different losses, and all
of them can promote face recognition performance. We here
examine the performance of the joint combination of them.

Table 2: Ablation studies of the improvements of different loss functions. The performance indicators are explained in the
caption of Table 1. The model of the first line without LCGâˆ’ArcF ace, LCluâˆ’Con and LCluâˆ’Ali, is the baseline model, which
uses ResNet-100 as backbone and the ArcFace loss as the classification loss.
The comparisons between the settings (setting4, setting5)
and setting1 demonstrate that both the supervised Cluster
Contrastive loss and the Cluster-Aligning loss can further
promote the performance of the Cluster-Guided ArcFace.
Furthermore, the comparisons between setting6 and the set-
tings(setting4, setting5) prove that the supervised Cluster
Contrastive loss and the Cluster-Aligning loss can promote
each other.This is because the cluster aligning procedure
helps to constrain the consistency of the cluster centers and
the learnable centers, which should be consistent in theory.
In summary, the comparisons between experimental settings
have illustrated the effectiveness of joint label classification
and supervised contrastive clustering and the contributions
of the proposed loss functions.
Comparisons with the Triplet Loss and Center Loss
The supervised Cluster Contrastive loss has shown con-
sistency in improving the performance of face recogni-
tion via clustering the face features iteratively. In compar-
ison, some metric losses, such as the Triplet loss (Schroff,
Kalenichenko, and Philbin 2015) and the Center loss (Wen
et al. 2016) can also play a similar role. We have conducted
experiments to compare our supervised Cluster Contrastive
loss, Triplet loss, and Center loss.

Table 3: Comparison between the supervised Cluster Con-
trastive loss and the Triplet loss and Center Loss. The per-
formance indicators are explained in the caption of Table 1.
For a fair comparison, we only replace the supervised
Cluster Contrastive loss with the Center Loss and the Triplet
loss and still utilize the Cluster-Guided ArcFace loss and
the Cluster-Aligning loss. The results in Table 3 show that
the proposed supervised Cluster Contrastive loss performs
better than the Center Loss and the Triplet Loss in the
five benchmarks, especially in the ones with more diffi-
cult samples(CFP-FP, AgeDB, IJB-B and IJB-C). Compared
with the Center loss, the supervised Cluster Contrastive loss
joint optimizes both the intra-class compactness and the
inter-class discrepancy. Compared with the Triplet loss, the
supervised Cluster Contrastive loss can meet more negative
samples and is adaptive to the hard level of clustering.
Effect of the Adaptive Temperature in LCluâˆ’Con
We verify the effect of the cluster-adaptive temperature Ï•s
in the supervised Cluster Contrastive loss is adjusted accord-
ing to the feature distribution in the cluster. We compare it
with the typical learnable temperature Ï„0, widely adopted in
the infoNCE (van den Oord, Li, and Vinyals 2018) loss, on
various benchmarks. As is illustrated in Table 4, the mod-
els using the cluster-adaptive temperature consistently out-
perform those using the typical learnable temperature on all
benchmarks. This proves it will promote better face repre-
sentation learning via making the temperature adaptive to
the hard level of face clustering.

Comparison of Feature Similarity Distribution
We also conduct a quantitive experiment to prove the effec-
tiveness of our approach. We illustrate the feature similarity
distribution on the CFP-FP and the AgeDB dataset. The red
bars show the cosine similarity distribution of negative pairs,
and the blue bars show the cosine similarity distribution of
positive pairs. The vertical dashed line indicates the expec-
tation of cosine similarity distribution. The margin between
the two vertical dashed lines can indicate the ability of face
verification.
Figure 2(a) and Figure 2(b), the margin between positive
pairs and negative pairs on the CFP-FP dataset is enlarged
from 0.463 to 0.524, which shows that our paradigm can im-
prove the face representation of the samples with large pose
variations. Similarly, the margin between positive pairs and
negative pairs on the AgeDB dataset is enlarged from 0.521
to 0.547, shown in Figure 2(c) and Figure 2(d). This result
proves that our paradigm can also improve the face represen-
tation of the samples with large age variations. The quanti-
tive experiment further validates the effect of our paradigm
on learning a better face representation.
Face Clustering
Similar to MagFace (Meng et al. 2021), our approach aims
to improve feature distribution structure and provide the in-

DBSCAN ArcFace
Table 5: F-score (%) and NMI (%) on clustering bench-
we compare the performance of our approach with the ones
of the baseline model(ArcFace) and the recent work Mag-
Face, via integrating their features with multiple clustering
methods. We utilize three clustering methods for evaluation:
K-means (Lloyd 1982), DBSCAN (Ester et al. 1996) and
L-GCN (Wang et al. 2019). Following the IJB-B clustering
protocol, we evaluate on three largest sub-tasks where the
numbers of identities are 512, 1024, and 1845. Normalized
mutual information (NMI) and BCubed F-measure (AmigÂ´o
et al. 2009) are employed as the evaluation metrics. Follow-
ing the IJB-B clustering protocol (Whitelam et al. 2017) we
evaluate on three largest sub-tasks where the numbers of
identities are 512, 1024, and 1845. Normalized mutual in-
formation (NMI) and BCubed F-measure are employed as
the evaluation metrics.
Table 5 illustrates the clustering results. The overall per-
formance can be consistently improved with stronger clus-
ter methods(K-means<DBSCAN<L-GCN) compared with
the baseline ArcFace model. Our approach improves both
F-score and NMI metrics over the baseline model, which
shows that our paradigm that jointly conducts label predic-
tion and supervised contrastive clustering can promote the
clustering performance. We also compare our approach with
the MagFace and our methods outperforms MagFace consis-
tently. Moreover, this may be contributed to that our Cluster-
Guided ArcFace directly utilizes the cluster concentration,
which contains more knowledge than face quality, to guide
the tuning of margin. On the other hand, our supervised clus-
ter contrastive loss conducts an explicit clustering procedure
to help learning better face representation. The clustering re-
sults further prove that our approach can improve the feature
representation.
