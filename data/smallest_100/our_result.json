    "article_text_summary": " we measured the mean @xmath0 diameter of the star 55  cancri as @xmath1 using the chara array in the h - band . together with photometric colors , bolometric fluxes ( as measures of the integrated starlight ) and trigonometric parallax from the hipparcos mission , this directly measured angular diameter of the star directly yields its physical diameter , @xmath2 .864 .0ld / dly .   @xmath4 .95 .   using also evolutionary models of early k stars , we estimate a mass of @xmath3 .895 .   this leads to radii for the individual planets orbiting the astrometric binary in the system ( planets e , f , and d , in the limits defined ( and given in detail in four tables ) i - iii) of 1.99 - 2.19 , 0.288 - 0.378 , and 0.769 - 0.078 @xmath6 , respectively , and equilibrium temperatures of 516 - 559 , 200 - 254 , and 193 - 237k .   planet f has the distinction of being located squarely within the super - earth / mini - neptune hz , which is concentrated near 0.7 au .   this makes the 55  cancri system attractive for further study , including the precise radial velocities and astrometric measurements needed to verify the planetary nature of the e and f candidate companions as well as to refine the orbits of all five planets."
