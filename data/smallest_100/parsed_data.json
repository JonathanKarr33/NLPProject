    "abstract_text": " we present the results of a multiwavelength campaign searching for young objects in the intragroup medium of seven compact groups of galaxies : hcg 2 , 7 , 22 , 23 , 92 , 100 and ngc 92 .   we used fabry - perot velocity fields and rotation curves together with galex nuv and fuv images , optical r - band and hi maps to evaluate the stage of interaction of each group .   we conclude that groups ( i ) hcg 7 and hcg 23 are in an early stage of interaction , ( ii ) hcg 2 and hcg 22 are mildly interacting , and ( iii ) hcg 92 , hcg 100 and ngc 92 are in a late stage of evolution .   evolved groups have a population of young objects in their intragroup medium while no such population is found within the less evolved groups .   we also report the discovery of a tidal dwarf galaxy candidate in the tail of ngc 92 .   these three groups , besides containing galaxies which have peculiar velocity fields , also show extended hi tails .   our results indicate that the advanced stage of evolution of a group together with the presence of intragroup hi clouds may lead to star formation in the intragroup medium .

    "article_text": "compact groups of galaxies are associations of three to seven galaxies , where the projected distances between them is of the order of their diameters , and where the group shows a low velocity dispersion , making compact groups an ideal place to study galaxy interaction and intergalactic star formation ( e.g. ( * ? ? ? * torres - flores et al . 2010 ) , ( * ? ? ? * de mello et al . 2008 ) , ( * ? ? ? * de mello , torres  flores & mendes de oliveira 2008 ) , ( * ? ? ? * mendes de oliveira et al . 2004 ) ) . the main goal of this work is to search for a link between the evolutionary stage of a group and the presence of young intergalactic objects which may have formed during galaxy interactions . for this , we analyze a subsample of seven compact groups ( hcg 2 , 7 , 22 , 23 , 92 , 100 and ngc 92 ) which span a wide range of evolutionary stages , from hi rich groups to strongly interacting groups , where the galaxies show tidal tail features and a deficiency in neutral hi gas . in order to analyze the evolutionary stage of each group , we used new fabry - perot velocity maps , galex / uv data and optical r - band images . the velocity fields and rotation curves help constraining the evolutionary stage of each compact group while ultraviolet light contains important information regarding the age of the young stellar population that may be present in the intragroup medium . we searched for ultraviolet emitting regions in the vicinity of all seven targets , using the sextractor software ( se , ( * ? ? ? * bertin & arnouts 1996 ) ) in the fuv , nuv and r sky - subtracted images of our compact group sample . we compare the field density of regions detected in the compact group with a control sample outside the group . hcg 92 and hcg 22 have the highest field density in this study . no excess was found in hcg 2 , hcg 7 , hcg 23 , hcg 100 and ngc 92 ( ( * ? ? ? * torres - flores et al . 2009 ) ) . in order to constrain the evolutionary stage of each compact group , we inspected the velocity field and rotation curve of each galaxy to search for interaction indicators , in a similar way to that done by ( * ? ? ? * plana et al .

    "article_text": "monitoring known radial velocity ( rv ) planets at predicted transit times , particularly those planets in relatively eccentric orbits , presents an avenue through which to investigate the mass - radius relationship of exoplanets into unexplored regions of period / periastron space beyond ( kane & von braun 2008 , 2009 ) . here we describe techniques for refining ephemerides and performing follow - up observations ( kane et al . these methods are used by the transit ephemeris refinement and monitoring survey ( terms ) . the transit window as described here is defined as a specific time period during which a complete transit ( including ingress and egress ) could occur for a specified planet . the size of a transit window will increase with time due to the uncertainties in the fit parameters , and thus follow - up of the transit window as soon as possible after discovery is optimal . figure 1 ( left panel ) shows the size of the transit window for a sample of 245 exoplanets . the transit windows of the short - period planets tend to be significantly smaller than those of long - period planets since , at the time of discovery , many more orbits have been monitored to provide a robust estimate of the orbital period . terms chooses targets that have small transit windows , medium - long periods , and a relatively high probability of transiting the host star .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ] the transit ephemeris for a particular planet can often be significantly improved with the addition of a handful of high - precision rv data . for example , the planet orbiting the star hd  231701 ( fischer et al . 2007 ) has a current transit window of @xmath082 days based upon the discovery data . the addition of four subsequent measurements as shown in figure 1 ( right panel ) would improve both the precision of the period and time of periastron passage , resulting in a reduction of the transit window to 3.7 days - a factor of almost 25 ! through selective observations at optimal times , we produce viable targets for photometric follow - up . a considerable number of high transit probability targets are difficult to monitor adequately during their transit windows because the uncertainties in the predicted transit mid - points are too high . the acquisition of a handful of new rv measurements at carefully optimised times can reduce the size of a transit window by an order of magnitude . this is described in more detail by kane et al . ( 2009 ) . figure 2 presents data acquired with the t10 0.8 m automated photoelectric telescope ( apt ) during a predicted transit time of hd  114762b . the transit window was refined to less than a day using lick rv data , and the transit of this planet was subsequently ruled out . the observations from this survey will lead to improved exoplanet orbital parameters and ephemerides even without an eventual transit detection . the results from terms will provide a complementary dataset to the fainter magnitude range of the _ kepler _ mission , expected to discover many intermediate to long - period transiting planets .

    "article_text": "what has been available to eso up to now are efficiency curves provided by the vimos consortium that are averaged over the four quadrants and were determined with laboratory measurements , not by observing standard stars . prompted by user requests to have separate efficiency estimates for each quadrant , two spectrophotometric standard stars were observed in 2006 : hiltner 600 for all filters , and ltt7379 for the u and b band . these observations were performed with the broadest possible slit ( 5@xmath0 ) and the grisms lr - blue ( for u , b , and v ) and lr - red ( for r , i , and z ) . under the assumption that the total star - light is contained in the slit , the efficiency curve is derived from the measured flux . the required input consists of the tabulated standard star flux , the extinction curve , and the grism transmission as provided by the vimos consortium . the resulting curves are shown in fig . [ smieske : fig1 ] . they are also available from the public vimos web - pages . there is good agreement between the newly derived efficiency estimates and those from the consortium . the substantial sensitivity drop in quadrant 3 for the u - band is found independently for both ltt 7379 and hiltner 600 ( note that the measurement for hiltner 600 was not used for the efficiency estimate in the u - band since it suffered from flux loss in all four quadrants , due to a slight misalignment of the standard within the slit ) . since the u - band photometric zero - points for q3 do not show such a strong drop , a centring problem due to instrument flexure is a possible reason for this lack of measured flux . in addition , the consortium estimate of the grism transmission in q3 for l@xmath13800  may be too high . we suggest that the efficiency estimates especially in the u - band be always re - scaled to the ( integrated ) photometric zero - points . in addition to the total instrument+telescope efficiency estimates , we used the continuum lamp screen flats taken with and without inserted filter to measure the filter transmissions for each quadrant . the results are shown in fig .

[ smieske : fig2 ] ) . the measured telescope+instrument efficiency curves for the vimos broad band filters agree very well with the consortium estimates . a discrepancy in the u - band is observed for one quadrant , possibly due to flexure and low grism transmission at short wavelengthes . the filter transmissions also agree very well , except for the b and especially u - band , where the newly measured transmission is about 20% lower .

    "article_text": "entanglement is one of the potential sources of quantum theory . it is the key concept and major resource for quantum communication and computation @xcite . in the last few years , enormous efforts has been made to investigate various aspects of quantum entanglement and its benefits in a number of setups , such as teleportation of unknown states @xcite , quantum key distribution @xcite , quantum cryptography @xcite and quantum computation @xcite . recently , the study of quantum entanglement of various fields has been extended to the relativistic setup @xcite and interesting results about the behavior of entanglement have been obtained . the study of entanglement in the relativistic framework is important not only from quantum information perspective but also to understand deeply the black hole thermodynamics @xcite and the black hole information paradox @xcite . the earlier investigations on quantum entanglement in the relativistic framework is mainly focused by considering isolated quantum systems . in fact , no quantum system can be completely isolated from its environment and may results in a non - unitary dynamics of the system . therefore , it is important to study the effect of environment on the entanglement in an initial state of a quantum system during its evolution . the interaction between an environment and a quantum system leads to the phenomenon of decoherence and it gives rise to an irreversible transfer of information from the system to the environment @xcite .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     if we compare the single qubit and the both qubits decohering situations , it becomes obvious that the entanglement loss is rapid when both the qubits are coupled to the noisy environment . for example , in the case of bit flip channel the concurrence behaves as a linear function of @xmath0 for single qubit decohering case whereas in the case of both qubits decohering case it varies as a parabolic function . nevertheless , the sudden death happens at the same value of @xmath0 , irrespective of the acceleration , for both cases under the action of bit flip and phase damping channels . for depolarizing channel , however , this is not true . in conclusion , we have investigated that the entanglement in dirac fields is strongly dependent on coupling with a noisy environment . this result is contrary to the case of an isolated system in which the entanglement of dirac fields survives even in the limit of infinite acceleration of rob s frame . in the presence of decoherence , the entanglement rapidly decreases and entanglement sudden death occurs even for zero acceleration . under the action of phase flip channel , the entanglement can regrow when both qubits are coupled to a noisy environment in the limit of large values of decoherence parameter . the entanglement disappears , irrespective of the acceleration , under the action of phase damping channel only when the channel is fully decohered both for single qubit and the two qubits decohering cases . however , under the action of depolarizing channel an early sudden death occurs for larger acceleration when both qubits are coupled to the environment . in summary , the entanglement generated by unruh effect in noninertial frame is strongly influenced by decoherence .

    "article_text": "rooted in the book of job , `` behemoth '' is a worthy accolade to bestow upon the class of red supergiants . this finds reason in the popular use of the word . thinking of the namesake polish death metal band , red supergiants are dying stars , and their explosive death sparks the production and distribution of metals . in the cult game final fantasy , behemoths are beasts most feared for their magic spell `` meteor '' ; indeed , red supergiants fabricate dust grains , a process enshrouded in mystery . princeton university s farlex wordnet describes behemoths as `` abnormally large and powerful '' , `` unusual '' , `` of exceptional importance and reputation '' , and that `` strongly influence the course of events ''  all applicable to red supergiants . and they are , simply put , `` whoppers '' . descendent from stars with birth masses in the region of 830 m@xmath0 , red supergiants become large , hundreds of r@xmath0 up to more than a thousand r@xmath0 , because their mantles become convective . the reason they become convective is because the energy production rate in the core can no longer be balanced by radiative diffusion and instead bulk motion is induced to transport the energy to the surface . this causes a drastic restructuring of the mantle , with a much shallower density gradient . it becomes optically thin at much larger radial distance from the core , and hence the temperature of the plasma where this happens is relatively low , @xmath14000 k , such that equilibrium is maintained ( @xmath2 ) .    to put this in perspective , a massive main sequence star would easily fit within the orbit of mercury , but its red supergiant progeny could swallow jupiter . at that point , it would take more than a decade to travel around its surface at a speed of 10 km s@xmath3 , which is little more than the thermal motions in the star s atmosphere but only a few times smaller than the escape speed from its surface . hence red supergiants oscillate on timescales of years , and their winds have speeds of just a few tens of km s@xmath3 taking tens of thousands of years for matter to move out to one parsec distance . this means that we may be able to read the immediate past of the red supergiant  even if it is no longer there  in the story told by its circumstellar medium . the low escape speed makes it easy for these stars to lose mass , but it critically depends on how long they spend their time doing this , how much mass they eventually will have lost . it also means that rotation at the mere km s@xmath3 level may already affect these stars . red supergiants matter , as actors and probes in processes that drive galaxy evolution . but there are some important aspects of their formation , evolution and behaviour that need to be better understood : +        + and finally , if close binary interaction does affect the evolution of a large fraction of the massive star population ( ( * ? ? * de mink ( 2014 ) ) , then observational and theoretical efforts must be promoted that aim to quantify these effects . 2012 , _ a&a _ , 548 , 113 2014 , _ apj _ , 782 , 7 2009 , _ a&a _ , 508 , 923 2014 , _ apj _ , 782 , l2 2015 , _ mnras _ , 447 , 3973 2009 , _ a&a _ , 504 , 115 2011 , _ a&a _ , 531 , 117 2015 , _ apj _ , 799 , 50 2006 , _ apj _ , 645 , 1102 2007 , _ apj _ , 667 , 202 2013 , _ a&a _ , 560 , 16 2011 , _ science _ , 333 , 1258 2015 , , 575 , 60 2012 , _ nature _ , 482 , 375 2013 , _ mnras _ , 433 , 1246 2015 , _ pasa _ , 32 , 16 2015 , _ apj _ , 799 , 158 2010 , _ aspc _ , 425 , 279 2013 , _ eas _ , 60 , 307 1999 , _ a&a _ , 351 , 559 2005 , _ a&a _ , 438 , 273 "

    "article_text": "recent years have seen a rapid increase in the interest in finite quantum spin systems , also known as molecular magnets or nanomagnets @xcite . molecular magnets typically consist of clusters of interacting spins that are magnetically isolated from the other clusters in the molecular solid by nonmagnetic ligands . formally , molecular magnets are materials in which the ground state has nonzero total spin . here we generalize this definition to include all systems of largely isolated clusters of interacting quantum spins . these materials are interesting both as simple model systems for the study of quantum magnetism and because they have possible applications as nanoscale computer memory elements @xcite . many realizations of finite spin clusters with various ionic spins , ground state spins and geometries have been reported in the literature ; some recent examples with s=1/2 ions are given in table  [ materials ] . theoretical results for the properties of finite s=1/2 quantum spin systems have appeared in several recent references , primarily in the context of experimental studies of specific materials . dimer results are reported in several studies of the s=1/2 spin dimer vo(hpo@xmath0)@xmath10.5h@xmath2o ; see for example johnson _ @xcite , tennant _ et al . _ @xcite and koo _ et al . theoretical properties of s=1/2 spin trimers have similarly been given in studies of candidate trimer materials ; see for example refs.@xcite . rather few general theoretical results have been reported for s=1/2 spin tetramers , since the results are more complicated and there are many more independent geometries and sets of superexchanges . specific cases of tetramers are considered by procissi  _ et al . _ @xcite ( s=1/2 square tetramer ) , gros  _ et al . _ @xcite and jensen  _ et al . _ @xcite ( an unsymmetric s=1/2 tetrahedral model of cu@xmath2te@xmath2o@xmath3(br@xmath4cl@xmath5 ) ) , kortz  _ et al . _ @xcite ( unsymmetric tetramer model of k@xmath6na[cu@xmath0k@xmath2(h@xmath2o)@xmath7(@xmath8-asw@xmath9o@xmath10)@xmath2]@xmath15.5h@xmath2o ) , and ciftja @xcite ( symmetric trimer with apical spin ) . more general reviews of quantum spin systems have been published by kahn @xcite ( thermodynamics ) and whangbo _ et al . _ @xcite ( local origins of magnetism , thermodynamics properties , and materials ) . studies of the dynamics of heisenberg spin clusters using a quasiclassical formalism have been reported in a series of papers by ameduri , efremov and klemm @xcite . waldmann @xcite has carried out calcuations of the inelastic neutron structure factor for cyclic heisenberg spin clusters which are quite similar to the results presented here . this increased level of interest in molecular magnets motivates more detailed theoretical investigation of the properties of finite quantum spin systems . for simple theoretical models such as the heisenberg model , clusters that consist of only a few interacting magnetic ions can be treated analytically , and closed - form results can be obtained for many physical observables . one especially interesting quantity is the inelastic neutron scattering structure factor , which is required for the interpretation of inelastic neutron scattering experiments . inelastic neutron scattering is very well suited to the investigation of magnetic interactions at interatomic scales , since the measured structure factor is sensitive to the local geometry and interactions of the magnetic ions . as this work is intended in part to facilitate future neutron scattering studies , the evaluation of this structure factor is one of our principal concerns .

    "article_text": "after the completion of the palomar - quest northern sky survey in september 2008 the quest large field camera ( ( * ? ? ? * baltay et al . 2007 ) ) was moved and installed on the 1.0-m eso schmidt in la silla and had first light on april 24 , 2009 . since september 2009 , the southern survey has been in routine observations ( ( * ? ? ? * andrews et al . 2008 ) ) and the telescope and camera are controlled from yale and fully robotic . we have 90@xmath1 of the time on the telescope with 10@xmath1 allocated to chile . the quest camera consists of 112 ccds of 600 @xmath2 2400 sarnoff thinned pixels , back illuminated devices with 13 @xmath3 m x 13 @xmath3 m pixel pitch . the camera covers an area of 4.6@xmath4 @xmath2 3.6@xmath4 on the sky and a plate scale of 0.86 arcsec / pixel . the survey covers @xmath51000 square degrees per night , primarily between @xmath625@xmath4 to allow for follow up from both hemispheres . the lsq variability ( sn and transient ) survey uses 60 sec exposures ( and the tno survey-180 sec ) taken twice a night with a cadence of 2 nights in one broad band filter of 4000 to 7000 ( qst*-band ) . the seeing at la silla for the 60 sec exposures is 1.7 arcsec fwhm , reaching depth of 20.5 mag . the lsq survey subtraction pipeline has started producing between 400 and 900 transient candidates each night ( fig.[fig3 ] ) . the lsq rr lyrae star ( rrls ) survey is searching the galactic halo for rrls that have v magnitudes between roughly 14 and 20 . because rrls are excellent standard candles , they provide a powerful probe of the density distribution of the halo , which is being examined for halo substructure . plotted are the v magnitude light - curves for three type ab rrls ( fig.[fig5](a ) ) , which illustrate the typical photometric precisions at these magnitudes . from their mean v magnitudes , we estimate that rrab 12574 , 10770 , and 5381 lie 7 , 13 , and 52 kpc from the sun , respectively .        a deep eclipsing cataclysmic variable ( ( * ? ? ? * rabinowitz et al . 2011a ) ) was discovered with eclipse depths @xmath75.7 magnitudes , orbital period 94.657 min , and peak brightness v@xmath518 at j2000 position 17h 25 m 54.8s , -64 deg 38 min 39 sec . light curves in b , v , r , i , z and j were obtained with smarts 1.3-m and 1.0-m telescopes at cerro tololo and spectra from 3500 to 9000 with the soar 4.3-m telescope at cerro pachon . the optical light curves ( fig.[fig5](b ) ) show a deep , 5-min eclipse immediately followed by a shallow 38-min eclipse and then sinusoidal variation . no eclipses appear in j. during the deep eclipse the measure of v - j @xmath7 7.1 corresponds to a spectral type m8 or later secondary . the spectra show strong hydrogen emission lines , doppler broadened by 600 - 1300 km s-1 , oscillating with radial velocity that peaks at mid deep eclipse with semiamplitude 500 @xmath6 22 km s-1 . it is suggested that lsq172554.8 - 643839 is a polar with a low - mass secondary viewed at high inclination . an apparent dwarf nova was discovered ( ( * ? ? ? * rabinowitz et al . 2011b ) ) on june 11.046 ( when the variable was at magnitude r = 16.3 ) and june 11.063 ut ( at r = 16.0)(fig.[fig6](a ) and ( b ) ) . a faint source is reported at this position in the guide star catalog v2.3.2 ( with bj = 20.76 ) . simultaneous visible and j - band observations were taken with andicam on the 1.3-m smarts telescope at cerro tololo . a spectrum ( range 0.350 - 0.966 nm ) taken on june 26 with gmos on the gemini south telescope reveals strong h - alpha and h - beta emission lines , with h - alpha clearly double - peaked , indicating the presence of an accretion disk with rotational velocity 1000 km / s .

    "article_text": "it has been suggested that the most massive planets in a planetary system can be formed by a process of gas collapse , independently of metallicity , whilst the lighter components would have formed via core accretion . this can lead to a situation in which massive planets that have originated relatively far away from the inner system , migrate inwards into it ( see * ? ? ? * and contribution by font - ribera et al . in this same volume ) . in this process , these more massive planets with larger semi - major axis , cross the gas disc centred around the central sun . when going through this dissipative process , the planets lose kinetic energy because of the friction with the gas . as a consequence , the inner disc is heated up and the semi - major axis of the planet shrinks . after some passages , the planet is trapped in the disc with a residual eccentricity . we propose this scenario as a plausible way of explaining the existence of massive planets distributed around a sun with non - zero eccentricities . we give results based on high - accurate dynamical simulations about the distribution of the orbital elements of the trapped objects in the disc . we find that the massive planets are typically captured after some @xmath0 yrs and the final eccentricity is non - negligible ( @xmath1 ) . we have recently developed an integrator bhint specialised for dynamical processes in the vicinity of a very massive particle , which relies in the assumption that the very massive particle dominates the motion of the smaller ones @xcite . for this new mechanism , we retain the hermite scheme as a basis . the bottleneck is , of course , the number of particles to be used . nonetheless , we resort to special - purpose hardware , the grape , a card specially developed to integrate the calculation of newtonian gravitational forces . the peak performance of one of these cards is of 130 gflop , roughly equivalent to 100 single pcs , which makes possible long simulations with a realistic particle number . we set initially a disc made out of @xmath2 small particles which is `` hosting '' a sun in the centre and follows a simple @xmath3 profile . the integrated mass is of some 5 jupiters and the radius of some @xmath4 au . the thickness of the disc is of about the diameter of the central sun and has a gap around the central sun which extends @xmath5 au . the mass of the central sun is @xmath6 . the mass forming the disc are all single - mass . the massive planet , a massive particle of 5 jupiters is set in an orbit such that the initial eccentricity with the sun is of @xmath7 . initially , the particle is 100 au away from the sun and the inclination angle is @xmath8 degrees . the system ( disc plus interloper ) is integrated until the interloper is trapped by the disc . in the figure we show the evolution of the orbital parameters . whilst we can not discuss them in detail because of the publication limits , we note that after some @xmath9 yrs the inclination has almost not changed as compared to its initial value . then , after a short time of @xmath10 yrs elapses , it abruptly decays from almost 80 degrees to a very small number , to be finally trapped in the disc after @xmath11 yrs . the energy , whilst it decays from the initial high value of 0.95 , is of @xmath1 when the massive planet is totally trapped in the disc , within a final semi - major axis which is well within the range of expectation . an extended and detailed scrutiny of the parameter space of this capture process we propose will be soon published elsewhere @xcite . the adressing of this scenario has direct bearing on our understanding of planetary dynamics and migration mechanisms .

    "article_text": "we observed the central parsec of the galactic center using an h band filter and seven intermediate band filters covering the k band with the ao assisted instrument naco at the eso vlt on paranal . this yielded eight point spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for 5914 sources . the spectral feature we used for stellar classification is the co bandhead absorption ( @xmath0 m ) , which allows the separation of late and early type stars . we determined its presence by fitting the seds with an extincted blackbody . our method produces reliable results for stars as faint as 15.5 mag in the k band ( k2iii or b2v stars , considering extinction and distance modulus ) , much deeper than previous studies . we classfied 322 stars as early type candidates and 2955 as late type . for the first time , it is now possible to study the early and late type population separately at this depth . only the latter can be expected to be dynamically relaxed due to its age ( gyrs ) . our new results show that the late type population indeed lacks the predicted cusp structure , showing a core instead ( see e.g. * ? ? ? the steep decline of the projected early type density towards the outer parts of the cluster ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) could be confirmed here as well ( for both see fig.[fig1 ] ) .    , resp . @xmath1 and @xmath2 for @xmath3 , red : late type stars , fitted with @xmath4 and @xmath5 for @xmath6 , blue : all identified stars , light blue : @xcite sources , right : klfs for different populations in the gc , with fitted power laws . ]    the total k band luminosity function of the central parsec is considerably flatter than that of the galactic bulge , with a power law index @xmath7 @xcite compared to @xmath8 @xcite . the power law slope we fitted to the late type klf alone agrees very well with that of the bulge , a surprising result since the gc cluster is assumed to be a dynamically separate entity ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) . we can also confirm the much flatter klf found for the early type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) to a much greater depth ( k@xmath915.5 instead of k@xmath913 - 14 ) . these new results have enhanced our knowledge of the stellar population in the gc considerably , although several points remain unclear . instead of a cusp , we find a depletion of giants in the very center , as already found by e.g. @xcite , for giants with k@xmath912 , with @xcite confirming our own results spectroscopically only recently . several possible causes for this have been suggested , such as collisions / envelope stripping , mass segregation and imbh / smbh infall scenarios ( see e.g. * ? ? ? the fact that the power law slopes of the bulge and the late type klf agree within errors points to a similar mass function and stellar evolution . how this agrees with both being dynamically separate entities needs to be determined . for our further results and a more detailed treatment of the issues mentioned above , please see @xcite . bartko , h. , martins , f. , trippe , s. , fritz , t. , genzel , r. , et al . 2010 , apj , 708 , 834b buchholz , r. m. , schdel , r. , eckart , a. 2009 , a&a , 499 , 483 dale , j. , davies , m. , church , r. , freitag , m. 2009 , mnras 393 , 1016 do , t. , ghez , a. , morris , m. , lu , j. , et al . 2009 , apj 703 , 1323d figer , d. , rich , r. , sunsoo , s. , morris , m. , & serabyn , e. 2004 , apj , 601 , 319 genzel , r. , schdel , r. , ott , t. , eisenhauer , f. , et al . 2003 , apj , 594 , 812 haller , j. w. , rieke , m. j. , rieke , g. h. , et al . 1996 , apj , 456 , 194 merritt , d. 2009 , arxiv:0909.1318 paumard , t. , genzel , r. , martins , f. , et al . 2006 , apj , 643 , 1011 - 1035 schdel , r. , eckart , a. , alexander , t. , et al . 2007 , a&a , 469 , pp.125 - 146 "

( wade g. _ et al . _ , 1997 , a&a , 320 , 172 ) in our dataset . to determine rotational period of hd 184927 we used magnetic field data obtained with sao zeeman analyzer and uwo photoelectric polarimeter ( see wade et al . 1997 ) and added dimapol measurements of @xmath2 and he 4922 line . @xmath2 measurements ( uwo + dimapol ) only give possible periods of 9.531072 and 9.522540 , with the latter barely within the 1-sigma error bar of the 1997 period estimate . the best ephemeris for this set is @xmath3 .    in order to estimate projected rotational velocity we used grid of nlte tlusty models with fixed teff , log g and microturbulence and combination of different [ si / h ] and vsini parameters to calculate several synthetic spectra for nine siii - siiii lines . the code computed equivalent widths for each case and compared it to the observed equivalent widths . for these calculations we adopted projected rotational velocity @xmath4 km / s . the longitudinal magnetic field and null measurements from the espadons spectra were computed from each lsd stokes v and diagnostic null profile , using an integration range from -200 to 200 km / s . the computed longitudinal field varies from -200 to 950 g. we used the oblique rotator model to model the magnetic curve assuming that the field can be described by a centred dipole . the best - fit model has the following parameters : beta=70 , bd=4500 , i=26 . to explore the consistency of magnetic field measured from different elements we built lsd masks containing lines of si , o , n , fe and he . the longitudinal magnetic field was also measured from the balmer lines halpha and hbeta . as one can clearly see , magnetic field from si , o , n and fe masks changes its sign while the field from he is not . at the same time the magnetic field of helium lines strongly correlates with the field measured from hydrogen halpha and hbeta lines . we find that the lines can be reproduced by a spot with @xmath5 radius and helium abundance n(he)/n(h ) = 2 . inversions were carried out with a modified invers13 code ( kochukhov o. _ et al . _ , 2013 , a&a , 550 , a84 ) . the grid of llmodels atmospheres ( shulyak d. _ et al . _ , 2004 , a&a , 428 , 993 ) was computed for teff=22000 , log g=4.0 and a range of he abundance . for this grid we computed nlte departure coefficients with tlusty . these model atmospheres and nlte departure coefficients were then used in the mdi code to calculate local he i 6678 line profiles . magnetic field was parameterized with a spherical harmonic expansion , similar to the tau sco analysis by donati et al . ( donati j .- f . _ _ , 2006 , mnras , 370 , 629 ) . we performed a dipole+quadrupole fitting , allowing full freedom ( toroidal field , independent poloidal radial and horizontal fields ) of the spherical harmonic expansion . we found that the field is mostly poloidal , with comparable contributions of the dipole and quadrupole terms . total fraction of poloidal component is 81.5% and toroidal component is 18.5% .

    "article_text": "the radiation emitted by physical processes ongoing in active galaxies sculpt a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) that spreads on a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum . multi - wavelength photometry is thus a rich source of information about the agn nature . one method to extract this information is through sed fitting , which consist in comparing the observed photometric data to a combination of physical models for agn components . it is customary to perform sed fitting using optimization methods as @xmath0-minimization , which defines the best fit as the combination of parameters which models the whole sed showing the minimal @xmath0 value . however , this method is statistically correct only under the assumption that the parameters are fully independent from each other and thus have a gaussian probability distribution . this assumption is a drawback of this method since the parameters describing agn physics are in most cases highly degenerated . to solve this issue we present agn__fitter _ _ , a bayesian sed fitting code for agn that allows an integral calculation of the posterior probability distributions of the model parameters taking into account degeneracies and correlations existing among them . agn__fitter _ _ samples the parameter space built by the agn models parameters using a markov chain monte carlo method . this consists in a random walk that is biased for regions of higher probability in the parameter space , making the code fast and efficient since no time is lost in non - interesting regions . built on the published code emcee ( ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * foreman - mackey et al . 2011 ) ) our mcmc code increases its efficiency taking advantage of multiprocessing by parallel tempering , i.e. exploring the parameter space with several chains simultaneously .    [ 0.96 ]        the dimension of the parameter space sampled by agn__fitter _ _ is constructed in this first version by 10 parameters , which rule the modeling of four agn components : the accretion disk radiation , the nuclear hot dust emission and the radiation emitted by the host galaxy and the star burst regions . for the accretion disk radiation ( big blue bump ) we use the model by ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * richards et al . ( 2006 ) ) , while the hot dust surrounding the disk is modeled by a continuous torus ( ( * ? ? ? * silva et al . 1994 ) ) . the contribution of the host galaxy to the full source radiation is modeled using ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ) templates , while the cold dust radiation produced in star burst regions is simulated using ( * ? ? ? * dale & helou ( 2002 ) ) templates . since many of these models cover equal regions of the spectrum it is important to take correlations into account . l0.48     agn__fitter _ _ constructs seds from existing physical models ( fig . 1 ) and calculate physical parameters that are interesting to agn physics , such as relevant integrated luminosities ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and parameters ruling the physics of the host galaxy , such as age , stellar mass @xmath4 and star formation rate ( sfr ) . moreover , agn__fitter _ _ provides both the marginalized and two - dimensional posterior density functions ( pdf ) of the parameters listed above . in this way degeneracies can not only be better visualized but also analyzed and treated ( fig.2 ) . finally , due to the code s bayesian methodology , the user is able to take advantage of prior constraints on the parameters distributions . in this way the information given by the likelihood function can be complemented , calculating robustly posterior probabilities of the parameters . agn__fitter _ _ is a robust statistical tool to model agn seds and to infer physical parameters from multiwavelength photometrical data . our code provides a vast statistical information about the inferred parameters allowing in this way an analysis of multiwavelength photometry cognizant of degeneracies and correlations , which is necessary for agn studies of general purpose .

[ fig : softstate ] ) .    during `` failed state transitions''(fst ) , i.e. , during times when the source reached its intermediate state , the linear rms - flux relation breaks down . we examined four fst : 1998 july 15 , 1999 dec 05 , 2000 nov 03 , and 2001  jan  29 ( indicated in fig . [ fig : rmsfluxvstime ] by dotted lines ) . comparing these events with the neighboring hard state observations , we notice that the rms - flux - relations of 1999 december  05 and 2000 november 03  being strictly linear before and after  change to an arch - like appearance during the fst itself ( see fig .  [ fig : failed ] ) . the other two examined fst also deviate from the linear relation , but these deviations are not as prominent . an explanation of the rms - flux - relation seems to be the modification of a theory which explains the psd of gbhc by the superposition of accretion disk ( ad ) instabilities occuring at several radii in the ad that are propagated towards the innermost region of the disk . local @xmath10 variations , which are caused by short term changes of the disk viscosity and whose time scale is dependent on radius , are superimposed on long term @xmath10 modulations . if the fractional amplitude of the @xmath10 variations is independent of the long term @xmath10 , a linear flux - rms relation will be observed @xcite . the rms - flux - relation will break down if the corona is severely disturbed this seems to be the case during the intermediate state of cyg  x-1 , in agreement with earlier results for the behavior of x - ray time lags @xcite . here , the observed x - ray time lag is much larger than during the normal hard state , which could indicate changes in the geometry of the ad corona , possibly related to the observed radio emitting outflow .

    "article_text": "rx j2115 - 5840 ( euve 211658.6 ) was discovered during the _ rosat _ ( voges et al 1996 ) and _ euve _ ( bowyer et al 1996 ) all sky surveys . subsequent ground based observations confirmed the source as a polar . schwope et al ( 1997 ) suggested that the orbital and spin periods of rx j2115 - 5840 differ by @xmath01% . this would make it the fourth near synchronous polar and the first one below the 23 hr period gap . we obtained 2 weeks of white light polarimetric observations in july - aug 1997 at saao to investigate this possibility . the circular polarisation data are shown in fig . [ cpol ] : the circular polarisation is generally either close to zero or shows positive excursions . however , there are occasions when negative polarisation is seen ( hjd 2450000 + 659 , 666 and 672 ) . these observations suggests that rx j211558 is not fully synchronised . ( 6,8 ) ( -3,-2 . )    to investigate the circular polarisation data more closely , we used a discrete fourier transform to obtain an amplitude spectrum ( fig [ power ] ) . the highest amplitude peak corresponds to a period of 110.889 mins  similar to the spectroscopic period of 110.8 mins reported by vennes et al ( 1996 ) . the second highest peak corresponds to a period of 109.547 mins  similar to the shorter of the two possible optical photometric periods , 109.84 and 109.65 mins , reported by schwope et al ( 1997 ) . if we assume that the binary orbital period is @xmath1=110.889 min and the spin period of the white dwarf is @xmath2=109.547 min we find the following more complex frequencies in the amplitude spectrum : 3@xmath1 , 2@xmath2 , 3@xmath2 , @xmath3 , 2@xmath4 , 4@xmath13@xmath2 . any other frequencies which are present have amplitudes lower than 1% . the spin - orbit beat frequency corresponds to a period of 7.1 days . ( 8,7 ) ( -4,-28.5 ) to make a more detailed investigation of these data we folded the circular polarimetry on the proposed spin and orbital periods and the spin - orbital beat period ( the left hand panel of fig [ beat_phase ] ) . folding the data which correspond to a discrete beat phase on the proposed spin period of the white dwarf , we find that the polarisation curve shows a negative excursion lasting approximately half the spin cycle . at other spin phases the polarisation is close to zero ( the right hand panel of fig [ beat_phase ] ) . at @xmath5=0.20 the polarisation is not significantly modulated . at other beat phases a prominent positive hump is seen in the folded spin polarisation curves , the peak of which advances in phase as @xmath5 increases . ( 8,7 ) ( -3.5,-29.5 ) in fully synchronous polars , the accretion flow is locked with respect to the binary orbital rotation frame and the bulk of the accretion flow is thought to be directed onto the geometrically preferred magnetic pole of the white dwarf . however , in the case of near - synchronous polars , the accretion flow rotates around the magnetic field of the white dwarf on the spin - orbit beat period . this has the effect that the accretion flow will be directed preferentially onto first one then the other magnetic pole of the white dwarf . at two phases of the spin - orbit beat period we expect that the flow will be equally directed onto both poles . this ` pole - switch ' will manifest itself most obviously in the circular polarisation curves where the polarisation will change sign after the accretion flow has ` switched ' poles . this is seen in the right hand panel of fig [ beat_phase ] where at @xmath60.00 the polarisation is modulated with a positive hump , but at @xmath60.07 and 0.17 it is modulated with a negative hump . we consider two accretion scenarios which are described in fig [ scenario ] . the phasing of the data on the spin , orbital and beat phases requires that the accretion flow must be directed onto the same magnetic field line at all spin - orbit beat phases implying that at some phases the flow must follow a path around the white dwarf before accreting . this is difficult to reconcile with simple views of how the accretion stream attaches onto the magnetic field of the white dwarf . possible reasons for this are described in a more detailed paper that has been submitted to _ "

[ fig : setup ] ) was self - triggered using one devoted antenna : its signal was filtered in an appropriate noise - free frequency band ( 33 - 65  mhz ) chosen after an exhaustive study in the observed local noise frequency spectrum , before entering the adc . the wide band waveform signals ( 1 - 100 mhz ) of the other antennas were registered when a voltage threshold was reached on the trigger antenna . the trigger threshold was set at 4  @xmath1 ( @xmath1 : the rms sky background noise ) , leading to an electric field sensitivity of 4  @xmath2v / m .    on figure [ fig : triggerlevel ] the evolution of the average counting rate at nancay is presented as a function of the trigger level expressed in unit of @xmath1 . the counting rate evolves greatly with the anthropic activities in the vicinity of the station of nancay and with the weather conditions .    except for the trigger antenna , transient signals on the antennas were hidden by radio transmitters signals . consequently , a numerical passband filter ( same as trigger frequency band ) was applied , offline , in order to observe coincidences involving several antennas @xcite . using the position and the timing differences between antennas , it was also possible to perform the trajectory reconstruction of the electromagnetic plane wave using a triangulation techniques across the array @xcite . this level of analysis enables us to bring in light several cosmic ray air shower candidates . in the second phase operating since mid 2004 , the above setup ( see fig . [ fig : setup2 ] ) has been completed with four double plastic scintillators @xcite placed at the corner of the dam array ( @xmath3 ) . the trigger of the experiment is made of the four particle detectors in coincidence , resulting on an event rate of 0.8 event / mn . all the antennas have now the same role and are passband filtered ( 24 - 82 mhz ) in order to increase the signal to noise ratio . the observation of coincident events on antennas and charged particle detectors ( fig . [ fig : r248e1782 ] ) demonstrates the association of antenna transient signals with the occurrence of extensive air showers . this unambiguous evidence of radio signals through the simultaneous detection of shower particles will allow , for the first time , the characterisation of the shape and amplitude of air showers associated radio pulses . a preliminary event rate of 1/(8 hours ) is observed with antenna multiplicity ranging from 3 to 6 .    from the corresponding deposited energy distribution in scintillators , one can infer the location of the air shower core . the time delays between the particle detectors allow the reconstruction of the shower axis . from these information , impact parameter effects can be studied especially those related to non vertical showers . the latter are expected @xcite to generate amplitude and shape field variations which will better show up in large atmosphere volumes accessible with radiodetection method . purposely , 5 antennas will be installed ( up to 400 m from the dam ) on a east - west line crossing the existing array . two effects , namely cerenkov emission and the classical far field , contribute to the radio emission of a shower @xcite . the line will also allow to study their respective influences and asseses the interest for designing a larger antenna array dedicated to ultra high energy cosmic rays . http://www.obs-nancay.fr/ and http://www - subatech.in2p3.fr/. ravel o. _ et al . * a518 * , 213 - 215 ( 2004 ) . dallier r. _ et al . sf2a 2003 scientific highlights _ , ed f. combes _ et al . _ ( edp sciences , 2003 ) . a. belltoile _ et al . _ , astro - ph/0409034 ( 2004 ) . m. boratav _ et al _ , _ proc . of the @xmath4icrc _ , rome , 954,(1984 ) . t. gousset , o. ravel and c. roy , _ astroparticle physics _ , * 22 * , 103 - 107 ( 2004 ) .

( 2003 ) . during this hims - sims transition  showed fast changes in its timing properties , but almost none in the 3 - 20 kev energy spectrum @xcite . in february 2004 a new outburst started , which reached a significantly lower peak flux than the 2002/2003 outburst ( buxton et al . 2004 ; smith et al . 2004 ; belloni et al . 2004 ; kuulkers et al . 2004 ) . to get broad - band coverage during the expected hims - sims spectral transition , simultaneous  and  observations were made . belloni et al . ( 2006 ) combined data from pca , hexte and ibis , and obtained good quality broad - band ( 3 - 200 kev ) energy spectra before and soon - after the transition . these spectra indicated steepening of the hard , high - energy component . also , the high - energy cut - off that was present at @xmath170 kev before the transition was not detected later . therefore , although spectral parameters at lower energies do not change abruptly through the transition , the energy of the cut - off increases or disappears rather fast ( within 10 hours ) . the power spectra before and after the transition showed significant differences ( see belloni et al . 2005 ; belloni 2008 ) : from strong band - limited noise and type - c qpo to much weaker noise and type - b qpo ( for a description of the properties of different types of qpo , see casella , belloni & stella 2005 ) .    in 2006 monitoring of  revealed low - level x - ray activity ( bezayiff & smith 2006 ; swank et al . 2006 ) until december , when a new strong outburst started @xcite . miller et al . ( 2007 ) triggered a public  too campaign on  which started on january 30th ( caballero - garcia et al . 2007a - e ) . we activated our campaign with the aim to follow the source through a hims - sims transition . unfortunately , we did not observe the main transition , as we did in 2004 , but managed to capture a secondary transition . in this paper , we report the results of the timing and spectral analysis of our  data from 2007 march 46 and of the quasi - simultaneous interval of the  public data .

    "article_text": "unlike the optical spectra of hot cspn , which are characterized by lines of hydrogen , helium and some light metals , the ultraviolet spectra are dominated by fe and ni lines ( schnberner & drilling 1985 ) . their observed strengths show large variations between different objects suggesting a possible spread in abundances . iron group lines are ideal temperature indicators ( fig.1 ) , which is important to set up a reliable temperature scale for the hottest cspn . effective temperatures of the hottest central stars are known with low accuracy only . as a temperature indicater one usually takes the relative strength of neutral and ionized helium lines in optical spectra , however , at very high temperatures neutral helium lines disappear . the sample of stars in our study includes seven very hot hydrogen - rich cspn . these are the same objects that are investigated by traulsen et al . ( these proceedings ) to derive temperature and gravity by utilizing uv lines from light metals , namely c , n , and o. this sample covers the hottest phase of post - agb evolution ( @xmath0@xmath170000k ) and includes four objects , which have been observed with fuse _ and _ hst / stis .    the fuse spectra cover the range 9101180  with a resolution of about 0.1 . fig.2 displays a section of the available spectra . they are ordered by increasing effective temperature ( starting from ngc1360 with 97000k , up to ngc6853 with 126000k ) which becomes obvious in the shift of the iron ionisation balance . only lines of fevi and fevii are labeled in this figure , and the numbers next to the identification bars are the respective log__gf _ _ values . we also detect lines of c , n , o and of other elements of the iron group . as yet unidentified spectral lines are possibly absorptions of covi ( 1139.4 ) , nivi ( 1096.6 , 1121.9 , 1125.4 , 1141.9 , 1145.0 , 1148.9 ) and mnvi ( 1088.7 , 1128.5 ) . in addition to the fuse observations , fig.2 displays a model spectrum which is plotted over the spectrum of ngc1360 . the model has solar abundances , and includes , besides h and he , lines from fevi and fevii . temperature and gravity of the model ( @xmath0 @xmath2 95000 k and log__g _ _ @xmath2 5.50 ) are close to those derived from the cno analysis mentioned above . note the h@xmath3 contamination of the fuse spectra other than ngc1360 . the very broad troughs in lss1362 are h@xmath3 lines , and one can see the matching ( relatively weak ) absorption in ngc7293 . a large fraction of the absorption features in ngc6853 are from warm h@xmath3 , which will have to be deblended to obtain the photospheric spectrum . the spectra are analyzed using nlte metal line blanketed model atmospheres in order to determine @xmath0 , surface gravity , and chemical composition . for model calculations we use the tbingen nlte model atmosphere package tmap ( werner & dreizler 1999 ) and the atomic data files of the iron group ions were prepared with the iron opacity interface `` ironic '' ( rauch & deetjen 2003 ) . the large number of iron lines calls for a statistical treatment of opacities . we include data from kurucz s ( 1991 ) line list . the final synthetic spectra contain only lines whose wavelength position is accurately known from laboratory measurements ( so - called pos tables of kurucz ) . so far , all models have solar abundances and include h and he , plus lines from fevi , and fevii . the possibility of using the fevi / fevii ionisation equilibrium as a temperature indicator can be seen by the disappearance of fevi lines and the increasing strength of fevii lines in the spectra of models with increasing effective temperature ( fig.1 ) . the decrease of the fevii line strengths in the hottest model is explained by a shift of the ionization balance from fevii to feviii . ( all models have log__g _ _ = 7 . ) our first calculations seem to confirm that the temperature of ngc1360 is indeed lower than previously thought . the study of cno lines arrived at a similar result . the iron abundance in ngc1360 is apparently close to solar . kurucz , r. l. 1991 , in stellar atmospheres : beyond classical models , ed . l.crivellari , i.hubeny , d.g.hummer , nato asi ser . c 341 , kluwer , dordrecht , p.441 rauch , t. , & deetjen , j. l. 2003 , in stellar atmosphere modeling , eds . i. hubeny , d. mihalas , & k. werner , asp conference proceedings , 288 , 103 schnberner , d. , & drilling , j. s. 1985 , apj , 290 , l49 werner , k. , & dreizler , s. 1999 , in computational astrophysics , eds . h.riffert & k.werner , journal of computational and applied mathematics , 109 , 65 "

    "abstract_text": " effective slam using a single monocular camera is highly preferred due to its simplicity . however , when compared to trajectory planning methods using depth - based slam , monocular slam in loop does need additional considerations .   one main reason being that for the optimization , in the form of bundle adjustment ( ba ) , to be robust , the slam system needs to scan the area for a reasonable duration .   most monocular slam systems do not tolerate large camera rotations between successive views and tend to breakdown .   other reasons for monocular slam failure include ambiguities in decomposition of the essential matrix , feature - sparse scenes and more layers of non linear optimization apart from ba .   this paper presents a novel formulation based on reinforcement learning ( rl ) that generates fail safe trajectories wherein the slam generated outputs ( scene structure and camera motion ) do not deviate largely from their true values .   quintessentially , the rl framework successfully learns the otherwise complex relation between motor actions and perceptual inputs that result in trajectories that do not cause failure of slam , which are almost intractable to capture in an obvious mathematical formulation .   we show systematically in simulations how the quality of the slam map and trajectory dramatically improves when trajectories are computed by using rl .

    "article_text": "for more than 50 years @xcite , a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) reaching the main sequence ( ms ) has been the most direct tool for measuring the star formation history in a stellar population . much of that work focused on the ages of simple stellar populations , such as star clusters , within our own galaxy . by the late 1980s , the leap in sensitivity and photometric precision offered by the widespread use of ccds , coupled with advances in stellar evolution models , allowed accurate estimates for the ages of galactic globular clusters @xcite . in the 1990s , the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the subsequent installation of the wide field planetary camera 2 enabled the measurement of star formation histories in more complicated populations throughout the local group . beyond the closest satellites of the milky way , these studies focused on the brighter and younger populations in dwarf galaxies @xcite . in 2001 , the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) was installed on hst , and its dramatic improvements in sensitivity , field of view , and sampling enabled dating of the oldest populations out to the edge of the local group . extremely deep acs imaging of andromeda ( m31 ) showed that its halo is surprisingly younger than our own @xcite , with over half of the halo younger than 11  gyr , and with 30% of the population at intermediate ages of 68  gyr ( figure 1 ) . the data from such long exposures are also useful for studying transient phenomena ( e.g. , microlensing , supernovae ) and variable stars @xcite . soon two more deep fields will be obtained in m31 s outer disk and giant tidal stream . because the acs field is extremely small compared to the size of local group galaxies ( e.g. , the m31 halo is several degrees across ) , hst can only produce pencil - beam samples in each major component of a nearby galaxy . m31 s complex substructure , seen in maps of its bright giant stars @xcite , can not be sampled at this depth within the remaining hst lifetime . there are two near - term avenues for major advances in the study of star formation histories utilizing upcoming optical space missions ( figure 2 ) : the supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) and the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) . the james webb space telescope will also make progress , but its infrared bands do not provide as good a temperature lever for ms stars .    as an optical telescope with the sensitivity and sampling of hst , but with a much larger field of view , snap could map the star formation history in the outer disk and halo of large galaxies like m31 and m33 . the observing program might consist of two stages : an exploratory stage , where shallow tiles across the galaxy provide secondary age diagnostics on the red giant branch and horizontal branch , and a deep followup stage , providing direct age diagnostics via ms photometry , sampling at a @xmath020% fill factor . current plans envision 0.1@xmath1 pixels ; 0.05@xmath1 is better suited to surveys of the m31 outer disk , while larger pixels would be restrict this work to the halo outskirts . its focal plane design ( with many fixed filters ) does not provide an efficient way to obtain two - band photometry over large fields , but the additional bands would provide tighter population constraints .    the optical coronograph version of the tpf , with its @xmath2 meter aperture , will provide high - contrast , high - resolution imaging over tiny fields of view as its prime mission . however , a secondary instrument with a wide field of view could obtain ms photometry in galaxies nearly 4 mpc away . currently , we are limited to the study of the two giant galaxies in the local group ( our own and andromeda ) plus a handful of smaller galaxies , but the volume of space that could be surveyed with tpf would include the cen - a group and the m81-m82 group ( figure 2 ) , greatly expanding the sample of galaxies . dohm - palmer , e.d . skillman , m. mateo , a. saha , a. dolphin , e. tolstoy , j.s . gallagher , and a.a . cole , deep hubble space telescope imaging of sextans a. i. the spatially resolved recent star formation history , _ aj _ * 123 * ( 2002 ) 813 - 831 . brown , h.c . ferguson , e. smith , r.a . kimble , a.v . sweigart , a. renzini , r.m . rich , and d.a . vandenberg , evidence for a significant intermediate - age population in the m31 halo from main sequence photometry , _ apj _ * 592 * ( 2003 ) l17-l20 . brown , h.c . ferguson , e. smith , r.a . kimble , a.v . sweigart , a. renzini , and r.m . rich , rr lyrae stars in the andromeda halo from deep imaging with the advanced camera for surveys , _ aj _ * 127 * ( 2004 ) 2738 - 2752 .

    "article_text": "galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models are useful tools to understand how galaxies form and evolve . in particular , abundance and abundance ratio trends can be read as records of different evolutionary histories and interpreted in terms of the different time scales on which different objects evolve ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . unfortunately , dealing with very complex and poorly known mechanisms such as mass accretion , star formation and stellar feedback , brings with it the need for many assumptions and parameters . as a consequence , gce models are by no means unique ( @xcite ) . therefore , it is worthwhile quantifying the uncertainties of gce predictions arising from different treatments of the physical processes involved with structure formation and evolution . here we concentrate on uncertainties due to different assumptions on the stellar imf . by comparing the model predictions with the available data , we show that particular imf slopes can be ruled out in the galaxy , whilst a `` standard '' solar neighbourhood imf is not suitable to describe the high metallicities observed in ellipticals . the most widely used functional form for the imf is an extension of the `` original mass function '' proposed by @xcite to the whole stellar mass range , @xmath0 for 0.1 @xmath1 100 . besides this , multi - slope expressions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and a lognormal form for the low - mass part of the imf ( @xmath2 1 @xmath3 ; @xcite ) are considered here . in the latter case , for the 1100 @xmath3 stellar mass range we adopt a power - law form with an exponent @xmath4 = 1.7 .    in fig .  1 we show the fractional masses falling in specific mass ranges according to different imf choices , for one single stellar generation . an example of what one gets when integrating over the galactic lifetime , i.e. over many stellar generations , is given in fig .  2 , where we display the predicted behaviour of [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] for all the imfs listed above . we choose oxygen because of its well understood nucleosynthetic origin ( @xcite ) and because the very high - quality data available for solar neighbourhood stars ( @xcite ) allow for a very meaningful comparison between model predictions and observations . although theoretical errors of the order of 0.20.3 dex can be associated to model predictions owing to the uncertainties in the actual imf form , it is apparent that both salpeter s and scalo s ( 1998 ) imfs overproduce oxygen for most of the galactic lifetime . generally , models assuming salpeter s , tinsley s or scalo s ( 1998 ) imfs are found to predict far too high global metal abundances ( @xmath5 0.0240.033 ) , especially if the most recent measurement of this quantity in the sun is taken into account ( @xmath6 = 0.0126 ; @xcite ) . the scalo ( 1998 ) imf also leads to overproduce @xmath7he from the time of solar birth up to now , due to its high percentage of 12 @xmath3 stars ( see fig .  1 ) . on the contrary , the remaining imfs all guarantee a good agreement between the model predictions and the data ( see romano et al . 2004 for details ) . therefore , from simple gce arguments we conclude that the imf of field stars in the solar neighbourhood must contain less massive stars than the salpeter one . an extrapolation of the salpeter law to the high - mass domain is not suitable to explain the solar neighbourhood properties . this is not surprinsing ; _ indeed , the salpeter slope of @xmath4 = 1.35 was originally derived for stars less massive than 10 @xmath3_. the observational properties of dwarf galaxies are better explained by assuming a salpeter - like stellar mass spectrum . this is true for both dwarf spheroidals ( @xcite ) and late - type dwarf galaxies ( romano , tosi and matteucci in preparation ) . on the other hand , the chemo - photometric properties of massive ellipticals at both low and high redshifts are better explained with an imf slightly flatter than salpeter s . in their pioneering work , @xcite showed that an imf with a power index smaller than salpeter , @xmath8 @xmath9 for 0.05 @xmath1 60 , gives an excellent fit to the observed colors of giant elliptical galaxies . we find that the chemo - photometric properties of local and high - redshift massive spheroids are well reproduced with an imf slope even more similar to salpeter s , i.e. @xmath8 @xmath10 for @xmath11 1 @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .    in conclusions , our gce models give us hints for ( small ) imf variations with star forming conditions . further studies have been presented at this workshop which seem to confirm our findings , from both a theoretical ( e.g. c. chiosi ; p. kroupa ; l. portinari , these proceedings ) and an observational ( e.g. s. lucatello , these proceedings ) point of view .

    "article_text": "currently accepted theories and many experimental results suggest that hadronic matter changes to quark matter in high - density and/or high - temperature regimes by way of the deconfinement transition . the properties of quark matter have been actively studied theoretically in terms of the quark  gluon plasma , color superconductivity @xcite , magnetism @xcite , and experimentally in terms of relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite , and early - universe studies and compact stars @xcite . such studies are continuing to provide exciting results @xcite . presently , we consider that compact stars consist of not only nuclear matter but also other matter such as hyperons and quarks . we call such stars _ hybrid stars_.    because many theoretical calculations have suggested that the deconfinement transition is of the first order at low temperature and high density @xcite , we assume that it is a first - order phase transition here . the gibbs condition @xcite then gives rise to various structured mixed phases ( smps ) . the smps proposed by heiselberg et al . @xcite and glenndening and pei @xcite suggest a crystalline structure for the mixed phase in the cores of hybrid stars . such structures are called `` droplets '' , `` rods '' , `` slabs '' , `` tubes '' , and `` bubbles '' . we present the equation of state ( eos ) for the mixed phase taking into account the charge screening effect @xcite without relying on any approximations . we investigate the inner structures of these stars @xcite . in this paper , we review the inner structures of hybrid stars and apply our eos to a stationary rotating star . we use the eos given in our paper @xcite , which is presented in our framework . therefore , our approach is only briefly explained here . thermal equilibrium is implicitly achieved at @xmath0 . we consider that the hadronic and quark matter and the mixed phase are @xmath1 stable . we employ density functional theory ( dft ) under the local density approximation @xcite . to account for the confinement , we introduce a sharp boundary between the two phases employing the bag model @xcite with a surface tension parameter @xmath2 . the determination of the surface tension between hadronic and quark matter is a difficult problem . thus , many authors have treated the surface tension as a free parameter and have observed its effect @xcite ; we take the same approach in this study . to determine the charge screening effect , we also conduct the calculations without the screening effect . we then apply the eos derived in our paper @xcite to the tolman  oppenheimer  volkoff ( tov ) equation @xcite . after that , we apply our eos to a stationary rotating star .        [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we see an important relation between radius and rotation . ordinarily , the `` radius '' of the star is single - valued because we consider that the star is spherical . however , if the star is rapidly rotating , we have to pay attention to the different `` radii '' . because of the effect of the rotation , a star deforms from a sphere to an ellipse . therefore , we introduce two values , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which are the  equatorial radius \" and the  polar radius \" , respectively . figure  [ r - f_sc ] shows @xmath3 and @xmath4 with respect to rotation . if the rotation rate is 400 hz or faster , the two radii are different . therefore , we have to note the effects of rotation on rapidly rotating stars . in this study , we demonstrated how charge screening affects the hadron  quark mixed phase in the cores of hybrid stars , taking into account rotation effects . we found that the inner structures are strongly affected . in particular , a core consisting of quark matter could appear due to the charge screening effect . another case , kaon condensation , has been studied @xcite and the results are similar to those of our papers @xcite . we used a simple model for quark matter and nuclear matter . to obtain a more realistic picture of the hadron  quark phase transition , we need to take into account color superconductivity @xcite and the relativistic mean field theory @xcite . we will then be able to provide more realistic results . neutron stars have other important physics  magnetic fields . however , the origin of these magnetic fields is still unknown . there are ways to explain magnetic fields based on the spin - polarization of the quark matter @xcite . however , whether the quark matter exists or not strongly depends on the eos . in this calculation , we did not take into account magnetic fields . if we include a magnetic field , the resluts are very interesting with respect to the rotation of the star . this work was supported in part by the principal grant of the kagawa national college of technology .

    "article_text": "virus particles ( virions ) come in a variety of sizes and shapes . however , approximately spherical shapes with diameters in the range between @xmath1 and @xmath2 are especially common . many nearly spherical viruses are revealed by x - ray crystallography to have icosahedral symmetry . a typical virus particle contains genetic material , rna or dna , surrounded by a protein coat ( capsid ) . such an object should have reasonably distinct vibrational frequencies , the study of which may be of interest . excitation of these vibrations could have applications in either the diagnosis or treatment of viral diseases . to this author s knowledge , the sole discussion of these vibrational modes in the literature is that of babincov _ et al _  @xcite . these authors discuss the conjecture that ultrasound in the ghz range could be resonantly absorbed by hiv virus particles , leading to their destruction . et al _  @xcite have recently reported the detection of viruses by acoustic oscillations . however , the process of `` rupture event scanning '' , which these authors report , involves the separation of a virus particle from antibodies by ultrasound . this is distinct from the excitation of the vibrational modes of the virus particle itself , and occurs at much lower frequencies . there have also been some experimental studies of ultrasonic absorption by empty viral capsids  @xcite . these experiments reveal an enhanced absorption in the mhz range as proteins reassemble into a capsid , but do not find a resonant peak in this frequency range . witz and brown  @xcite have emphasized that these and other results show that viral capsids are flexible and change size or shape in response to vibrations or to changes in temperature or ph . the purpose of the present paper is to provide some estimates of the lowest vibrational frequencies of a spherical virus particle . the simplest estimate is to take this frequency to be of the order of a characteristic speed of sound divided by the size of the virus particle . this is the estimate used in ref . @xcite . for the purpose of giving a more accurate estimate , we will examine two models , which treat the particle ( 1 ) as a liquid drop and ( 2 ) as a uniform elastic sphere . similar models have been used by bulatov _ @xcite to estimate the vibrational frequencies of nanoclusters . consider a sphere of radius @xmath3 filled with a nonviscous liquid with surface tension @xmath4 and mass density @xmath5 . the lowest vibrational mode of this sphere will be a quadrupole mode with frequency  @xcite @xmath6 which can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the mass density and surface tension for water , respectively . the surface tension and mass density , along with the lowest vibrational frequency derived from eq .

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we can see that for a wide range of materials , the lowest mode of vibration is a purely radial mode with a frequency of the order of a few times @xmath12 for a sphere of radius @xmath10 . in the previous sections , we have examined two models for a spherical virus particle , a liquid drop model and an elastic sphere model . it is of interest that the two models yield estimates for the lowest vibrational frequency which differ by only about one order of magnitude . of the two models , the elastic sphere model is probably the better description of a virus particle . an even better model might be one in which the particle has a liquid core ( dna or rna ) surrounded by an elastic outer shell ( the capsid ) . such a model would probably yield vibrational frequencies intermediate between those predicted by the two models discussed in this paper . in any case , we obtain an estimate for the lowest vibrational frequency of the same order of magnitude as that given in ref . @xcite , in the range of a few ghz for particles with a size of about @xmath13 . of course , the existence of a resonance requires that damping be below the critical value above which overdamped motion occurs . even if this condition is fulfilled , it is difficult to predict the width of the resonance . this remains a question for experimental investigation . the existence of well defined resonances could prove valuable both for basic science and for medicine . thus this is a potentially fruitful area for further research .

( 2003 ) and calculated the locations of certain minimal orbital period values ( where two identical model stars are in contact ) . the cleaned sample contains about 2800 lmc binaries . detached and semi - detached binaries are spread uniformly in the period - k magnitude plane , while there is a well - defined sequence for the contact systems . we found that the widely accepted sequence of eclisping binaries between seqs . c and d , known as seq . e , does not exist . the correct position for seq . e is at periods a factor of two greater . a simple roche - model describes seq . e very well . although seq . e seems to merge into seq . d of the long secondary periods ( wood et al . 2004 ) , the two groups are significantly different in their color and amplitude properties ( derekas et al . 2006 ) . from the 8 years of macho observations we measured period changes using the o  c method applied to seasonal subsets of the data . we found about 80 parabolic and 45 cyclic period changes , the rest showing linear o  c diagrams . a significant fraction of the former two groups are candidates for light - time effect in hierarchic triple systems . one example is shown in the top panels of fig . 2 . in about 40 eccentric binaries we measured different o  c variations for the primary and the secondary minima , which indicates apsidal motion ( bottom panels in fig . 2 ) . with this we double the number of known binaries with apsidal motion in the lmc ( michalska & pigulski 2005 ) .      in a few objects we discovered gradual amplitude variation , which can be explained by rapid variations in the orbital geometry , most likely in inclination . a third body in the system can perturb the eclipsing pair in such a way that the eclipse depth , as a sensitive indicator of the inclination variations , follows these perturbations . in fig . 3 we present an example ( @xmath3 ) , for which the large scatter in the o  c diagram may suggest an orbital period of @xmath4 for the hypothetical third companion .        this work has been supported by the australian research council . llk is supported by a university of sydney postdoctoral research fellowship . ad is supported by an australian postgraduate research award . this paper utilizes public domain data obtained by the macho project , jointly funded by the us department of energy through the university of california , lawrence livermore national laboratory under contract no . w-7405-eng-48 , by the national science foundation through the center for particle astrophysics of the university of california under cooperative agreement ast-8809616 , and by the mount stromlo and siding spring observatory , part of the australian national university .

    "article_text": "temperature profiles of galaxy clusters are of great importance for two main reasons : firstly they allow us to measure the total mass of these systems through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation and secondly they provide informations on the thermodynamic state of the intra cluster medium ( hereafter icm ) . measurements of temperature profiles have been performed with the the first generation of x - ray satellites carrying telescopes operating in the medium energy band ( 2 - 10 kev ) , namely asca and bepposax . a detailed description of results obtained with these experiments may be found in de grandi & molendi ( 2002 ) and refs . therein .    in the last 3 years various authors have published xmm - newton temperature profiles of individual clusters . arnaud et al . ( 2003 ) with a sample of 7 objects comprising 5 clusters and 2 groups find that the temperature profiles are essentially isothermal within @xmath1 , and possibly declining at larger radii , where the statistics is rather limited . recently , zhang et al . ( 2003 ) have published temperature profiles for a sample of 9 clusters , in the outer regions they find both flat and strongly decreasing profiles , however they do not provide a mean temperature profiles of their sample . in this note we derive the mean temperature profile for a sample of hot , medium distant clusters whose profiles are available from the literature and compare it with our mean bepposax profile . we have selected from the literature all hot ( i.e. kt@xmath2 kev ) clusters in the redshift range between 0.1 and 0.3 with an available projected radial temperature profile . the resulting sample comprises a total of 15 clusters : 9 reflex clusters at redshift @xmath3 ( zhang et al . 2003 ) , a1413 at z=0.143 ( pratt & arnaud 2002 ) , a2163 at z=0.201 ( pratt et al . 2001 ) , a1835 at z=0.250 ( majerovitz et al . 2002 ) , pks 0745@xmath4191 at z=0.1028 ( chen et al . 2003 ) , zw 3146 at z=0.291 and e1455@xmath5223 at z=0.258 both taken from mushotzky ( 2003 ) . the adopted redshift range allows us to compare the temperature profiles measured from xmm - newton data with those derived from bepposax observations . the profiles published for the clusters in the xmm - newton sample extend out to @xmath6 from the core , corresponding to physical radii of @xmath7 mpc ( h@xmath8 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 ) . the same physical radii are reached by bepposax observations of clusters laying in the @xmath10 redshift range and detected out to @xmath11 ( see de grandi & molendi 2002 ) . the average cluster temperature of the xmm - newton sample is @xmath12 7 kev , very similar to that of the bepposax sample ( @xmath13 kev ) . we have converted all temperature uncertainties at the 90% confidence level into errors at the 68% c.l . by dividing them by the scaling factor 1.65 . for each cluster we have computed the virial radius @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) from the relation derived by evrard et al . ( 1996 ) : @xmath16 using published cluster mean temperatures and redshifts .    visual inspection of fig.1 , where we report the individual xmm - newton temperature profiles , shows that the profiles are about isothermal from 0.10 to @xmath17 ; beyond @xmath17 there seems to be a decline . it is also clear that points at @xmath18 are heavily fluctuating and tend to have larger errors . we have modelled the xmm - newton profiles in fig . 1 with a power law and converted the slope into the polytrophic gas index accordingly to the calculation reported in the appendix of de grandi & molendi ( 2002 ) . in the range @xmath19 we have obtained a polytrophic index @xmath20 , which is close to the isothermal value 1 . whereas , for @xmath21r@xmath22 we have found @xmath23 , which is formally above the adiabatic limit of 5/3 , although consistent at the 68% confidence level with values below 5/3 . the drop in the profiles at @xmath12 0.55 r@xmath24 ( clearly visible in fig . 2 ) highlights a possible problem in the xmm - newton profiles . the binned error - weighted average temperature profile computed from the 15 clusters is shown in fig . 2 , where we also plot the bepposax cool core and non cool core clusters profiles ( see de grandi & molendi 2002 for details ) . we have added here to the bepposax cool core clusters the ophiuchus cluster . the xmm - newton and bepposax profiles are in good agreement between 0.05 and 0.25 @xmath0 . from 0.25 to about 0.5 @xmath0 both profiles decline , however the bepposax profile does so more rapidly than the xmm - newton profile . the presence of a temperature jump , at the limit of convective stability , at the largest radii explored with xmm - newton , hints to a problem possibly related to the low signal - to - noise ratio of the outermost cluster regions and to the difficulties in operating a correct background subtraction ( see molendi these proceedings for a discussion of this issue ) .

    "article_text": "many online algorithms base their model update on the margin of each example . passive online algorithms , such as rosenblatt s perceptron @xcite and crammer et al s online passive - aggressive algorithms @xcite , update the algorithm s model only if the value of the margin falls below a defined threshold . these algorithms fully evaluate the margin for each example , even if the model is not to be updated ! the running time of these algorithms is linear either in the number of features , or in the dimensionality of the input space . contemporary models may have thousands of features making running time daunting . the budgeted learning community addresses this problem by putting a budget on the number of features a classifier can evaluate while learning and while making predictions . our work stems from the theoretical framework suggested by ben david and dichterman @xcite , and is closely related to recent work by cesa - bianchi et al . @xcite as well as reyzin @xcite . we differ by the fact that we do not impose a hard budget constraint on the number of features , but rather look at the probability of making decision errors . decision error are errors that occur when the algorithm stops the feature evaluation process , predicts its outcome , and is wrong . this work extends on previous work by pelossof et al . @xcite . we propose a new method for early stopping the computation of feature evaluations for uninformative examples by connecting the perceptron algorithm to sequential statistical tests @xcite ( figure [ fig : attentive - perceptron ] . ) this connection results in a general method that makes margin based learning algorithms attentive , which means that they have the ability to quickly filter uninformative examples . the margin of each example is computed as a weighted sum of feature evaluations . informative examples are misclassified examples , which force the perceptron to preform a model update , whereas uninformative examples are correctly classified and therefore ignored by the perceptron . we break up the feature evaluation for every example in the stream . the breakup of every example allows the attentive perceptron to make a decision after the evaluation of each feature about whether the feature evaluation should continue or be stopped . this decision making process allows us to stop the evaluation of features early on examples with a large partial margin after having evaluated only a few features . for example , examples with a large partial margin are unlikely to have a negative full margin . therefore , rejecting these examples early achieves large savings in computation . we define the mathematical setup to derive the stopping conditions for margin evaluation . let @xmath0 be weakly dependent random variables . let a partial sum be defined by @xmath1 and the remainder sum by @xmath2 . the expectation of a sum is denoted by @xmath3 and its standard deviation by @xmath4 . the perceptron compares the margin ( a sum ) to a threshold , and updates its model if the margin of the example is negative . we formulate the equivalent sequential decision making process , and drive constant stopping thresholds @xmath5 . these thresholds will essentially tell us when it s highly unlikely for the margin to end below the desired importance threshold @xmath6 . the stopping thresholds are derived by requiring that the joint distribution of stopping ( and predicting @xmath7 ) while the actual full sum satisfies @xmath8 is less than a required error rate @xmath9 @xmath10 we bound the probability of making a decision error @xmath11 equation [ eqn : rw_reflection ] is derived by applying the reflection principle , and equation [ eqn : flat_reflection_standerdized ] is its standardization . since we assume that @xmath0 are weakly independent , the sum @xmath12 is approximately normally distributed by the central limit theorem . by standardizing @xmath13 we upper bound the probability of making a decision error with the inverse normal cumulative distribution function @xmath14 . therefore , requiring that the probability of making a decision error be less than @xmath9 we get the following equality from equation [ eqn : flat_reflection_standerdized ] @xmath15 the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be approximated using the empirical data .    finally , by solving for the stopping threshold @xmath5 we get from equation [ eqn : boundary_inequality ] @xmath18 therefore , examples with partial margin calculations @xmath19 that hit this boundary should be filtered and with probability at least @xmath20 determined that their full margin satisfies @xmath7 . in summary , we presented a simple test to speed up the perceptron algorithm by quickly filtering unimportant examples without fully evaluating their features . this results in an algorithm which typically focuses on examples by the decision boundary - the attentive perceptron .

    "article_text": "the mystery of the dark energy / cosmological constant persists despite great efforts of particle physicists and cosmologists to find a convincing solution . since the famous article by s. weinberg , it is well known that candidate models should not only explain the smallness of the cosmological constant , if it is somehow related to quantum gravity , but also what is called the coincidence problem i.e. why does dark energy become dominant quite late in the history of the universe ? models inspired by string theory like 4-form gauge models can describe the smallness of the dark energy but not the coincidence problem . anthropical models explain the latter problem but it is very difficult to find a natural and convincing particle physics model for them . the same problem somehow exists for the alternative to a cosmological constant i.e. for quintessence models . even if tracker solutions make the model not very sensitive to the initial conditions , some fine tuning of the slope of the potential is necessary . it is also an open question if both inflation and quintessence behavior can be explained by the same field and if not , what is their relation and which type of particle physics can provide both of them specially in a natural way . + here we suggest an alternative to a primordial quintessence field . there are at least two motivations for the existence of a decaying dark matter ( ddm ) . if r - parity in susy models is not strictly conserved , the lsp which is one of the best candidates of dm can decay to standard model particles . violation of this symmetry is one of the many ways for providing neutrinos with very small mass and large mixing angle . another motivation is the search for sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) . in this case , ddm must be composed of ultra heavy particles with @xmath2 . in a recent work we have shown that the lifetime of uhdm ( ultra heavy dark matter ) can be relatively short , i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the age of the universe ( astro - ph/0001137 ) . + if a very small fraction of the mass of primary ddm particles changes to a scalar field with proper self interaction potential , the gradual condensation of this field at late time behaves like a quintessential matter . the advantage of this model to others is that late time yield of this type of energy and its correlation with the amount of dark matter comes up naturally and the dominance of one with respect to the other at each epoch is automatically explained . + in the present work we only study the plausibility of this model . we postpone a more detailed study to elsewhere . the natural choice of cosmological parameters for this model is an initial @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an early time in the history of the universe . for the result presented here we consider it to be the time of decoupling of cmb photons ; @xmath7 . the remnants of the decay else than quintessence field mainly consist of very energetic particles which will contribute to the yield of hot dark matter . there is strict constraint on the amount of the latter from cosmological observations and the model must be consistent with observations . however , one should not forget that massive particles like proton / ant - proton and even electrons become colder with the expansion of the universe and at some point they are not any more considered as hot . in fact it can be shown that the whole effect on the equation of state of the universe is the reduction of the effective @xmath8 of the cosmological constant or a quintessence matter ( astro - ph/0002400 ) . + we summarize our preliminary results in two following figures . the first figure shows @xmath9 of the fit of quintessence models on the publicly available super - novae ia data . models with @xmath0 fit the data better than @xmath10 . +    the second figure shows the evolution of density of various types of matter from decoupling of cmb photons to today for a typical selection of parameters . in one hand it shows that it is possible to obtain the present `` equivalent '' value of cosmological parameters without fine tuning of the suggested model . another conclusion is that the appearance of cosmological parameters as measured in the local universe is very recent i.e. the measurement of cosmological parameters at high redshift permits to distinguish between this model and other quintessence models . it is evident that the model presented here can not be believed before investigating many issues . the first and one of the most important ones is the condensation of the scalar field . one should determine the mass and the form of the potential and find the region of the parameter space that in a natural way can lead to a late condensation . the other issue is that the value of @xmath8 for this type of matter can not be constant . this can affect the evolution of halos , star formation rate , ionization of igm etc . and can be used to verify the model .

[ fig : fig3 ] above ) . the fit was noticeably better within the central portion of the mirror and when apertured down to 90% of the clear aperture the agreement was roughly 20 @xmath0 @xmath1 . it is important to note that these results are significant because they represent open - loop `` go - to '' control of the surface without the benefit of feedback from residual wavefront measurements . hence these results are applicable to systems which need to run open - loop like moao configurations mentioned earlier . we have tested the suitability of the alpao dm52 as a woofer dm and have shown it has promising open - loop characteristics . initial results look good for woofer - tweeter implementation in our mcao testbed . beckers j. m. _ eso conference on very large telescopes and their instrumentation _ , 693 ( 1988 ) . tallon , m. foy , r. _ a&a _ , * 235 * , 549 ( 1990 ) . ammons , s. m. laag , e. a. gavel , d. t. & kupke , r. _ proc . spie _ , * 6272 * ( 2006 ) . awwal , b. j. bauman , b. j. gavel , d. t.   _ proc . spie _ , * 5169 * , 104 ( 2003 ) . keskin , o. hamptom , p. conan , r. bradley , c. hilton , c. & blain , c. _ proc . of the first nasa / esa conference on adaptive hardware and systems _ ( 2006 ) . the authors are grateful for funding from the gordon & betty moore foundation , whose generous gift enabled the construction of the laboratory for adaptive optics at the university of ca , santa cruz . the authors also acknowledge the generous support of the bachmann family . this work has been supported by the national science foundation science and technology center for adaptive optics , managed by the university of california at santa cruz under cooperative agreement no . ast - 9876783 .

    "article_text": "recent exciting results from the searches for high - redshift type ia supernov  ( sne ia ) have been interpreted as suggesting that there is indeed a cosmological constant and that the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( perlmutter 1999 and riess 1998 ) . the results on the cosmology are robust in that they are independent of the value of the hubble parameter , @xmath4 , ( as they use redshift , @xmath5 ) and also of the local calibration of the sne ia luminosities ( as the distance modulus is used ) . they do rest upon an underlying assumption that the local and global values of @xmath4 are the same ( so that the distance - redshift relationship does not change ) .    here we examine how different the local value of @xmath4 must be from the global value in order to significantly change the cosmology derived from the fitting of high - redshift sne ia data to the hubble diagram . a similar approach was taken by kim ( 1997 ) to fit data from the first 7 high - redshift sne ia between @xmath6 ; in this paper we extend that work with a much larger number of supernov  in the range @xmath7 . ( it should also be noted that the data used by kim favoured an @xmath8 cosmology at the time . ) the idea that the local universe is atypical has been suggested by numerous authors ( see dekel 1994 for a review ) . hudson ( 1999 ) report evidence for a large scale bulk flow on scales possibly greater than 14000 km s@xmath9 . plionis & kolokotronis ( 1998 ) show that there may be contributions to the x - ray cluster dipole from beyond 16000 km s@xmath9 . lauer & postman ( 1994 ) and scaramella ( 1992 ) suggest the possibility of even larger density inhomogeneities out to a distance of 15000 - 30000 km s@xmath9 . phillips & turner ( 1998 ) see that near - ir galaxy counts out to @xmath10 are deficient which may be due to a local underdensity on such scales , implying that the local value of the hubble parameter @xmath4 is up to 30 per cent higher than the global value . tammann ( 1998 ) also sees a decrease in the value of @xmath4 out to 18000 km s@xmath9 of 7 per cent .    whilst these claims are not without their detractors it is clear that a body of work exists to suggest that the local value of @xmath4 may not be the same as the global value and could be higher . see turner , cen & ostriker ( 1992 ) for a detailed discussion of this topic . we assume that the value of @xmath4 on scales greater than @xmath11 is equal to the global value , and then fit open and flat cosmologies to the high - redshift sne ia data , shifting the zero - point of the data to find the best fit to the various cosmologies . the difference in zero - points between the local and high - redshift supernov  is then used to calculate the difference between the local and global values of the hubble parameter .    using the corrected data for 10 high - redshift sne ia presented in tables 5 and 6 of riess ( 1998 ) and for 40 supernova cosmology project ( scp ) high - redshift sne ia from table 1 of perlmutter ( 1999 ) we reconstruct the hubble diagrams . the shift in the local - to - global hubble parameter required to fit various flat and open cosmologies are then calculated using a @xmath12 fit , also finding the 95 per cent confidence limits . figure 1 shows the required local - to - global ratio of the hubble parameter to fit the scp sne ia data . the best fit when @xmath13 in fig . 1(a ) is the well - known @xmath14 cosmology found by perlmutter ( 1999 ) . more interestingly a variety of low @xmath2 open cosmologies are not rejected at the 95 per cent level even if @xmath13 . in order for an @xmath15 open cosmology to be the best fit to the data then @xmath16 is required . the recovery of critical mass density cosmologies is more difficult . they are rejected at greater than the 99 per cent level if @xmath17 and need a large ratio @xmath18 . the data of riess ( 1998 ) was also examined and the fits are very similar to those presented in fig . 1 although they are less significant due to the much lower number of data points . generally the riess data are slightly less consistent with a low @xmath2 open cosmology and @xmath8 critical cosmologies are ruled out at a higher confidence level , requiring a 1.2 to 1.3 @xmath19 ratio . to fit best a low @xmath2 open cosmology then the @xmath19 ratio must be 1.1 - 1.2 . if the local value of the hubble parameter is higher than the global value on scales of a few 100 @xmath20 mpc then the fitting of cosmological parameters to the high - redshift sne ia data of perlmutter ( 1999 ) and riess ( 1998 ) may be inappropriate . previously popular cosmologies such as open or critical matter density universes with no cosmological constant may be acceptable if we live in a local underdensity . whilst large underdensities of scales up to 300 - 600 @xmath20 mpc are not expected from standard power spectra , there is some observational evidence that we may live in such an underdensity ( see section 2 ) , a possibility which is not ruled out by these results . it seems that is too early yet to abandon the traditional models .

planet configurations , which will serve as test - cases for habitability considerations . section [ sec : stab ] briefly mentions the dynamical requirements which binary - planet configurations have to fulfill in order to ensure system stability . in section [ sec : sec ] the maximum radiative influence of the second star on a terrestrial planet in the primary s hz is estimated and compared to actual insolation simulations . the occurring differences are being investigated in the following section . finally , generalized , analytical estimates are developed and compared to numerical simulations in sections [ sec : ana ] & [ sec : num ] , and the results concerning the behavior of hzs in binary star systems are presented in section [ sec : res ] . a discussion of the results concludes this article . ccc f0 & 1.90 & 0.46 + g2 & 1.41 & 0.36 + m0 & 1.05 & 0.27    apart from planetological and dynamical aspects , the insolation a terrestrial planet receives from its host star is naturally the main driver determining the extent of the hz . when considering planets within a binary star system it is therefore important to track the combined radiation of both stars arriving at the planet . kwr93 showed that not only the sheer amount of insolation , but also the spectral distribution is essential to estimate limiting values for atmospheric collapse . in order to model the impact of diverse stellar spectral classes on an earth - like planet s atmosphere , kwr93 introduced so - called effective radiation values . these measure the relative impact a comparable amount of radiation ( e.g. 1360 @xmath1 $ ] ) with different spectral properties has on a planet s atmosphere . taking the effects of different stellar spectra into account is especially important in binary star systems with different stellar components [ tab2 ] reproduces the effective radiation values for the inner ( runaway greenhouse ) and outer ( maximum greenhouse ) edge of a single star s hz as given in kwr93 . notice how the onset of runaway greenhouse effects requires almost twice as much radiation for a spectral distribution akin to f0 class stars compared to m0 spectral types . even though @xcite assume similar effective radiation values for m and k spectral classes , actual calculations have only been done for f0 , g2 and m0 zams stars . for this reason , we first investigate the following three stellar configurations : "

    "article_text": "a structure of a si(001 ) epitaxial layer surface , especially its defects , could affect the formation of nanostructures . perfect , defectless si epilayers grown on si(001 ) vicinal substrates are of special importance for such industrially significant problem as controllable formation of ge / si(001 ) nanostructures for optoelectronic device applications . this report covers experimental investigation of structural properties of surfaces of si epitaxial layers deposited on si(001 ) vicinal surfaces of substrates with different miscuts . experiments were carried out in uhv using gpi-300 stm coupled with riber eva 32 mbe chamber [ 1 ] . epitaxial layers were deposited by mbe on substrates cut from si(001 ) vicinal wafers tilted @xmath00.2 towards the [ 110 ] or [ 100 ] direction . initial surfaces were treated by the rca etchant . before si deposition , we cleaned the surfaces by the standard methods of preliminary annealing at 600 and decomposition of the sio@xmath1 film under a weak flux of the si atoms at 800 [ 2 ] . the substrate temperature during si deposition was chosen in the range from 360 to 700 . we have explored structural properties of si epitaxial films deposited on si(001 ) vicinal substrates depending on the growth temperature and the rate of si deposition . two modes of si epitaxial growth have been observed . we have found that the step - flow growth goes on at the temperatures above 600 whereas the island growth takes place at the temperatures below 600 . samples grown at the step - flow growth mode have smooth surfaces composed of terraces bounded by monoatomic steps . stm data shown in figs . 1 and 2 are related to the si epilayers deposited on the wafers tilted towards the [ 110 ] and [ 100 ] direction respectively .      at first , we consider stm data for si / si(001 ) surfaces tilted towards the [ 110 ] direction . the surface is composed by s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 monoatomic steps [ 3 ] ; s@xmath3 steps are wider than s@xmath2 ones . we have observed formation of such defects as faceted pits on these surfaces . in fig .  1 , an initial stage of the defect formation is shown . there observed the local stoppage of growth of an s@xmath3 step and appearance of two s@xmath2 steps instead . in other words , we have observed a gap of the s@xmath3 step . the s@xmath2 steps repulse each other and the defect can not be overgrown quickly . the bottom of the deep pit has a rectangular shape and a long side of it formed by the s@xmath2 step . stm data for the si / si(001 ) surface tilted towards the [ 100 ] direction are presented in fig .  2 . the surface is composed by bent monoatomic steps . in this case every monoatomic step consists of short parts of s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 steps and runs along the [ 100 ] direction . there are local disarrangements of the structure . we suppose this kind of defects to be connected with a process of transition from the mixed s@xmath2+s@xmath3 monoatomic step to two single s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 steps instead of formation of the d@xmath3 step .    we have investigated the structural properties of the si film surface depending on the rate of si deposition . we have found that reduction of the si deposition rate from  0.3 / c ( fig .  2 ) to 0.1 / c ( fig . 3 ) results in appearance of the structure formed by monoatomic steps running along the [ 110 ] direction and formation of shapeless pits on the surface instead of the structure formed by the bent monoatomic steps which run along the [ 100 ] direction .      in figs .  4 and 5 , we present stm data for surfaces of the epilayers deposited at the temperatures of 550 and 470 .    surfaces of the samples grown at 550 consist of s@xmath2 and s@xmath3 monoatomic steps ( fig .  4 ) the mixed s@xmath2+s@xmath3 monoatomic steps which are typical for the si(001 ) surfaces tilted towards [ 100 ] and obtained at higher temperatures are not observed . at this temperature , the transitional mode of the epilayer growth , intermediate between the island growth and the step - flow one , is observed for both tilt directions .    further reduction of the temperature down to 470 results in the island growth mode ( fig .  5 ) . the si / si(001 ) surface is composed by small islands . in both causes such defects as pits are present on the surface . the structural properties of the surfaces of si epilayers grown at the island growth mode do not depend on the direction of the surface tilt . summarizing the above we can conclude that processes of generation and growth of surface defects arising during epitaxial growth of si films on si(001 ) vicinal substrates depend on tilt direction of a si(001 ) wafer and the epilayer growth conditions . we suppose the observed effects to be a consequence of mutual interactions of monoatomic steps .    this research has been supported by the ministry of education and science of russian federation through the contracts no . 14.740.11.0069 and 16.513.11.3046 . facilities of center of collective use of scientific equipment of gpi ras were utilized in this research . we appreciate the financial and technological support .
