    "article_text": "the cyg  x-1 data presented here were obtained by the pca onboard rxte , mostly gained through our monitoring campaign 19982002 ( for a description of the data see @xcite ) .\nwe split each light curve into segments of 1s length and determine the mean flux of each segment .\nthe segments are binned into 41 equally segmented flux bins , for each of which we calculate the power spectral density ( psd ) of all contained lightcurve segments via the dft ( see , e.g. , ) .    from all periodograms of each flux bin the mean psd is determined using standard methods . for better statistics we chose to take into account only flux bins containing at least 20 periodograms .\nintegrating the poisson noise corrected psd over the range @xmath0@xmath1hz , we arrive at the squared fractional rms variability . in a next step\nwe multiply the fractional rms variability by the mean flux of the bin , to obtain the absolute rms variability @xmath2 .\nfor all bins of each observation we plot @xmath2 over flux @xmath3 and fit a linear function in two different representations . by fitting @xmath4 , two characterizing values are determined : slope @xmath5 and intercept @xmath6 on the @xmath2 axis .\nthe gradient of the @xmath2-@xmath3-trend @xmath5 is equivalent to the fractional rms variability of the light curve .    alternatively to intercept @xmath6 , it was proposed to determine the physically meaningful intercept @xmath7 on the @xmath3 axis by fitting @xmath8 @xcite .\nif @xmath5 is interpreted as the variable component of the lightcurve , then @xmath7 represents a second component of it which does not follow the linear @xmath2-@xmath3-trend . in deriving results\n, it should be kept in mind that @xmath7 , which is identical to @xmath9 , and @xmath5 are not independent values for the characterization of the rms - flux - relation .\ngenerally , there is a good linear relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the hard state , which is reflected by the stable pearson correlation coefficient in fig .\n[ fig : rmsfluxvstime ] .\nwe also notice coincidence of the change of the general long term behavior of cyg  x-1 from a `` quiet hard state '' to a `` flaring hard state '' in 1998 may @xcite with a shift in the values of slope @xmath5 and the intercepts .\nthe shape of the rms - flux - relation in the soft states of 1996 and 2001/2002 changes continuously between waviness and approximate linearity ( see fig .  [\nfig : softstate ] ) .    during\n`` failed state transitions''(fst ) , i.e. , during times when the source reached its intermediate state , the linear rms - flux relation breaks down .\nwe examined four fst : 1998 july 15 , 1999 dec 05 , 2000 nov 03 , and 2001  jan  29 ( indicated in fig .\n[ fig : rmsfluxvstime ] by dotted lines ) . comparing these events with the neighboring hard state observations ,\nwe notice that the rms - flux - relations of 1999 december  05 and 2000 november 03  being strictly linear before and after  change to an arch - like appearance during the fst itself ( see fig .  [ fig : failed ] ) .\nthe other two examined fst also deviate from the linear relation , but these deviations are not as prominent .\nan explanation of the rms - flux - relation seems to be the modification of a theory which explains the psd of gbhc by the superposition of accretion disk ( ad ) instabilities occuring at several radii in the ad that are propagated towards the innermost region of the disk .\nlocal @xmath10 variations , which are caused by short term changes of the disk viscosity and whose time scale is dependent on radius , are superimposed on long term @xmath10 modulations . if the fractional amplitude of the @xmath10 variations is independent of the long term @xmath10 , a linear flux - rms relation will be observed @xcite . the rms - flux - relation will break down if the corona is severely disturbed\nthis seems to be the case during the intermediate state of cyg  x-1 , in agreement with earlier results for the behavior of x - ray time lags @xcite . here\n, the observed x - ray time lag is much larger than during the normal hard state , which could indicate changes in the geometry of the ad corona , possibly related to the observed radio emitting outflow .\n"

    "article_text": "for more than 50 years @xcite , a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) reaching the main sequence ( ms ) has been the most direct tool for measuring the star formation history in a stellar population .\nmuch of that work focused on the ages of simple stellar populations , such as star clusters , within our own galaxy . by the late 1980s , the leap in sensitivity and photometric precision offered by the widespread use of ccds , coupled with advances in stellar evolution models , allowed accurate estimates for the ages of galactic globular clusters @xcite . in the 1990s , the launch of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) and the subsequent installation of the wide field planetary camera 2 enabled the measurement of star formation histories in more complicated populations throughout the local group . beyond the closest satellites of the milky way , these studies focused on the brighter and younger populations in dwarf galaxies @xcite .\nin 2001 , the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) was installed on hst , and its dramatic improvements in sensitivity , field of view , and sampling enabled dating of the oldest populations out to the edge of the local group .\nextremely deep acs imaging of andromeda ( m31 ) showed that its halo is surprisingly younger than our own @xcite , with over half of the halo younger than 11  gyr , and with 30% of the population at intermediate ages of 68  gyr ( figure 1 ) .\nthe data from such long exposures are also useful for studying transient phenomena ( e.g. , microlensing , supernovae ) and variable stars @xcite . soon\ntwo more deep fields will be obtained in m31 s outer disk and giant tidal stream . because the acs field is extremely small compared to the size of local group galaxies ( e.g. ,\nthe m31 halo is several degrees across ) , hst can only produce pencil - beam samples in each major component of a nearby galaxy .\nm31 s complex substructure , seen in maps of its bright giant stars @xcite , can not be sampled at this depth within the remaining hst lifetime .\nthere are two near - term avenues for major advances in the study of star formation histories utilizing upcoming optical space missions ( figure 2 ) : the supernova acceleration probe ( snap ) and the terrestrial planet finder ( tpf ) .\nthe james webb space telescope will also make progress , but its infrared bands do not provide as good a temperature lever for ms stars .    as an optical telescope with the sensitivity and sampling of hst , but with a much larger field of view , snap could map the star formation history in the outer disk and halo of large galaxies like m31 and m33 .\nthe observing program might consist of two stages : an exploratory stage , where shallow tiles across the galaxy provide secondary age diagnostics on the red giant branch and horizontal branch , and a deep followup stage , providing direct age diagnostics via ms photometry , sampling at a @xmath020% fill factor .\ncurrent plans envision 0.1@xmath1 pixels ; 0.05@xmath1 is better suited to surveys of the m31 outer disk , while larger pixels would be restrict this work to the halo outskirts .\nits focal plane design ( with many fixed filters ) does not provide an efficient way to obtain two - band photometry over large fields , but the additional bands would provide tighter population constraints .    the optical coronograph version of the tpf , with its @xmath2 meter aperture , will provide high - contrast , high - resolution imaging over tiny fields of view as its prime mission . however , a secondary instrument with a wide field of view could obtain ms photometry in galaxies nearly 4 mpc away .\ncurrently , we are limited to the study of the two giant galaxies in the local group ( our own and andromeda ) plus a handful of smaller galaxies , but the volume of space that could be surveyed with tpf would include the cen - a group and the m81-m82 group ( figure 2 ) , greatly expanding the sample of galaxies .\ndohm - palmer , e.d .\nskillman , m. mateo , a. saha , a. dolphin , e. tolstoy , j.s .\ngallagher , and a.a .\ncole , deep hubble space telescope imaging of sextans a. i. the spatially resolved recent star formation history , _ aj _ * 123 * ( 2002 ) 813 - 831 .\nbrown , h.c .\nferguson , e. smith , r.a .\nkimble , a.v .\nsweigart , a. renzini , r.m .\nrich , and d.a .\nvandenberg , evidence for a significant intermediate - age population in the m31 halo from main sequence photometry , _ apj _ * 592 * ( 2003 ) l17-l20 .\nbrown , h.c .\nferguson , e. smith , r.a .\nkimble , a.v .\nsweigart , a. renzini , and r.m .\nrich , rr lyrae stars in the andromeda halo from deep imaging with the advanced camera for surveys , _ aj _ * 127 * ( 2004 ) 2738 - 2752 .\n"

    "article_text": "galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) models are useful tools to understand how galaxies form and evolve .\nin particular , abundance and abundance ratio trends can be read as records of different evolutionary histories and interpreted in terms of the different time scales on which different objects evolve ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . unfortunately , dealing with very complex and poorly known mechanisms such as mass accretion , star formation and stellar feedback , brings with it the need for many assumptions and parameters . as a consequence , gce models are by no means unique ( @xcite ) .\ntherefore , it is worthwhile quantifying the uncertainties of gce predictions arising from different treatments of the physical processes involved with structure formation and evolution .\nhere we concentrate on uncertainties due to different assumptions on the stellar imf . by comparing the model predictions with the available data ,\nwe show that particular imf slopes can be ruled out in the galaxy , whilst a `` standard '' solar neighbourhood imf is not suitable to describe the high metallicities observed in ellipticals .\nthe most widely used functional form for the imf is an extension of the `` original mass function '' proposed by @xcite to the whole stellar mass range , @xmath0 for 0.1 @xmath1 100 . besides this , multi - slope expressions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and a lognormal form for the low - mass part of the imf ( @xmath2 1 @xmath3 ; @xcite ) are considered here . in the latter case ,\nfor the 1100 @xmath3 stellar mass range we adopt a power - law form with an exponent @xmath4 = 1.7 .    in fig .  1 we show the fractional masses falling in specific mass ranges according to different imf choices , for one single stellar generation .\nan example of what one gets when integrating over the galactic lifetime , i.e. over many stellar generations , is given in fig .  2 , where we display the predicted behaviour of [ o / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] for\nall the imfs listed above .\nwe choose oxygen because of its well understood nucleosynthetic origin ( @xcite ) and because the very high - quality data available for solar neighbourhood stars ( @xcite ) allow for a very meaningful comparison between model predictions and observations .\nalthough theoretical errors of the order of 0.20.3 dex can be associated to model predictions owing to the uncertainties in the actual imf form , it is apparent that both salpeter s and scalo s ( 1998 ) imfs overproduce oxygen for most of the galactic lifetime .\ngenerally , models assuming salpeter s , tinsley s or scalo s ( 1998 ) imfs are found to predict far too high global metal abundances ( @xmath5 0.0240.033 ) , especially if the most recent measurement of this quantity in the sun is taken into account ( @xmath6 = 0.0126 ; @xcite ) . the scalo ( 1998 ) imf also leads to overproduce @xmath7he from the time of solar birth up to now , due to its high percentage of 12 @xmath3 stars ( see fig .  1 ) .\non the contrary , the remaining imfs all guarantee a good agreement between the model predictions and the data ( see romano et al .\n2004 for details ) .\ntherefore , from simple gce arguments we conclude that the imf of field stars in the solar neighbourhood must contain less massive stars than the salpeter one .\nan extrapolation of the salpeter law to the high - mass domain is not suitable to explain the solar neighbourhood properties . this is not surprinsing ; _ indeed ,\nthe salpeter slope of @xmath4 = 1.35 was originally derived for stars less massive than 10 @xmath3_.\nthe observational properties of dwarf galaxies are better explained by assuming a salpeter - like stellar mass spectrum .\nthis is true for both dwarf spheroidals ( @xcite ) and late - type dwarf galaxies ( romano , tosi and matteucci in preparation ) . on the other hand , the chemo - photometric properties of massive ellipticals at both low and high redshifts\nare better explained with an imf slightly flatter than salpeter s . in their pioneering work\n, @xcite showed that an imf with a power index smaller than salpeter , @xmath8 @xmath9 for 0.05 @xmath1 60 , gives an excellent fit to the observed colors of giant elliptical galaxies .\nwe find that the chemo - photometric properties of local and high - redshift massive spheroids are well reproduced with an imf slope even more similar to salpeter s , i.e. @xmath8 @xmath10 for @xmath11 1 @xmath3 ( @xcite ) .    in conclusions ,\nour gce models give us hints for ( small ) imf variations with star forming conditions .\nfurther studies have been presented at this workshop which seem to confirm our findings , from both a theoretical ( e.g. c. chiosi ; p. kroupa ; l. portinari , these proceedings ) and an observational ( e.g. s. lucatello , these proceedings ) point of view .\n"

    "article_text": "nowadays intriguing theoretical extensions of the standard model are being explored , while the experimental results continue to confirm the validity of the model and constrain its extensions . given the limited energy range available at colliders , it is therefore vital to develop experimental probes that can climb up the energy ladder . a complementary way to analize these extensions while waiting for colliders of the next generations\nis provided by cosmic rays , which exceed the energy scales currently attainable .\nwe have undertaken the preliminary steps in a program that aims to utilize cosmic rays as an experimental probe of theoretical generalizations of the standard model .\nwe have in mind possible applications of cosmic rays for the study of supersymmetry .\nthe first is in the context of top - down models of ultra \nhigh  energy cosmic rays ( uhecr ) , around and above the greisen  zatsepin \nkuzmin cutoff . in these models\nthe primary cosmic rays originate from the decay of a metastable superheavy particle which decay at rest , fragmenting into ordinary hadrons and photons .\nthe dynamics of these decays can be modelled using standard qcd tools on which we elaborate below .\nwe propose to analize supersymmetric effects in the decay of these metastable states using 2 scales :    * a high energy @xmath0 fragmentation scale @xmath1 ( decay of a metastable state @xmath2 primary protons ) * a collision scale @xmath3 due to the interaction of surviving primaries with air - nuclei ( @xmath4 tev )    at both scales supersymmetric scaling violations should be included and the multiplicities of the spectrum analized .\nas an illustration of the procedure we adopt in our studies , let s consider the decay of a hypothetical massive state of mass 1 tev into supersymmetric partons .\nthe decay can proceed , for instance , through a regular @xmath5 channel and a shower is developed starting from the quark pair .\nthe @xmath6 dglap equation describes in the leading logarithmic approximation the evolution of the shower which accompanies the pair , and we are interested in studying the impact of the supersymmetry breaking scale ( @xmath7 ) on the fragmentation . in our runs\nwe have chosen the initial set of ref .\n@xcite .\nwe parameterize the fragmentation functions as @xmath8    typical fragmentation functions in qcd involve final states with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and kaons @xmath12 .\nwe have chosen an initial evolution scale of @xmath13 gev and varied both the mass of the susy partners ( we assume for simplicity that these are all degenerate ) and the final evolution scale . in general\nthe effects of supersymmetric evolution are small within the range described by the factorization scales @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( @xmath16 gev , @xmath17 gev ) .\nwe mention that @xmath14 is the starting scale ( the highest scale ) at which the decay of the supersymmetric partons starts .\n@xmath15 is fixed by the gluino / squark masses and coincides with them .\nthe situation appears to be completely different for the gluon fragmentation functions ( f.fs ) ( fig .  1 ) .\nthe regular and the sqcd evolved f.f.s differ largely in the diffractive region , and this clearly will show up in the spectrum of the primary protons if the decaying state has a supersymmetric content .\nas we raise the final evolution scale we start seeing more pronounced differences between regular and supersymmetric distributions .\nwe have shown in fig .\n2 the squark f.f.s for all the flavours and the one of the gluino for comparison . the scalar charm distribution appear to grow slightly faster then the remaining scalar ones .\nthe gluino f.f .\nis still the fastest growing at small - x values .\nin a few years several experiments , including the pierre auger experiment @xcite , will start collecting data from cosmic rays .\nthe issue of the origin of uhecr will be -hopefully- clarified . while the link of uhecr to agn s has been disfavored on the basis of a quite homogeneous distributions , the local origin of these events\nremains an open possibility .\npotential meta \nstable superheavy string relics have been suggested as dark matter candidates , as well as potential sources for the uhecr @xcite .\na qcd / sqcd analysis of these events is in progress . with the forthcoming experimental data @xcite , and\nimproved theoretical analysis , along the lines discussed here , cosmic ray physics enters an exciting new era , with potentially ground  breaking discoveries .\nc. corian and a.e .\nfaraggi , * hep - ph/0106326*. b.a .\nkniehl , g. kramer , b. ptter , nucl .\nphys .   * b582 * 514 ( 2000 ) .\nthe pierre auger observatory , the auger collaboration , + nucl.phys.proc.suppl.85 ( 2000 ) 324 .\ns. chang , c. corian , and a.e .\nfaraggi , phys . lett .\n* 397 , * 76 ( 1997 ) ; nucl . phys .\n* b477 , * 65 ( 1996 ) ; + c. corian , a.e .\nfaraggi and m. plumacher * hep - ph/0107053*.\n"

    "article_text": "the mystery of the dark energy / cosmological constant persists despite great efforts of particle physicists and cosmologists to find a convincing solution . since the famous article by s. weinberg\n, it is well known that candidate models should not only explain the smallness of the cosmological constant , if it is somehow related to quantum gravity , but also what is called the coincidence problem i.e. why does dark energy become dominant quite late in the history of the universe ?\nmodels inspired by string theory like 4-form gauge models can describe the smallness of the dark energy but not the coincidence problem .\nanthropical models explain the latter problem but it is very difficult to find a natural and convincing particle physics model for them .\nthe same problem somehow exists for the alternative to a cosmological constant i.e. for quintessence models .\neven if tracker solutions make the model not very sensitive to the initial conditions , some fine tuning of the slope of the potential is necessary .\nit is also an open question if both inflation and quintessence behavior can be explained by the same field and if not , what is their relation and which type of particle physics can provide both of them specially in a natural way .\n+ here we suggest an alternative to a primordial quintessence field\n. there are at least two motivations for the existence of a decaying dark matter ( ddm ) .\nif r - parity in susy models is not strictly conserved , the lsp which is one of the best candidates of dm can decay to standard model particles .\nviolation of this symmetry is one of the many ways for providing neutrinos with very small mass and large mixing angle .\nanother motivation is the search for sources of ultra high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) . in this case\n, ddm must be composed of ultra heavy particles with @xmath2 . in a recent work\nwe have shown that the lifetime of uhdm ( ultra heavy dark matter ) can be relatively short , i.e. @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the age of the universe ( astro - ph/0001137 ) .\n+ if a very small fraction of the mass of primary ddm particles changes to a scalar field with proper self interaction potential , the gradual condensation of this field at late time behaves like a quintessential matter .\nthe advantage of this model to others is that late time yield of this type of energy and its correlation with the amount of dark matter comes up naturally and the dominance of one with respect to the other at each epoch is automatically explained .\n+ in the present work we only study the plausibility of this model .\nwe postpone a more detailed study to elsewhere .\nthe natural choice of cosmological parameters for this model is an initial @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an early time in the history of the universe . for the result presented here\nwe consider it to be the time of decoupling of cmb photons ; @xmath7 .\nthe remnants of the decay else than quintessence field mainly consist of very energetic particles which will contribute to the yield of hot dark matter .\nthere is strict constraint on the amount of the latter from cosmological observations and the model must be consistent with observations .\nhowever , one should not forget that massive particles like proton / ant - proton and even electrons become colder with the expansion of the universe and at some point they are not any more considered as hot .\nin fact it can be shown that the whole effect on the equation of state of the universe is the reduction of the effective @xmath8 of the cosmological constant or a quintessence matter ( astro - ph/0002400 ) .\n+ we summarize our preliminary results in two following figures .\nthe first figure shows @xmath9 of the fit of quintessence models on the publicly available super - novae ia data .\nmodels with @xmath0 fit the data better than @xmath10 .\n+    the second figure shows the evolution of density of various types of matter from decoupling of cmb photons to today for a typical selection of parameters .\nin one hand it shows that it is possible to obtain the present `` equivalent '' value of cosmological parameters without fine tuning of the suggested model .\nanother conclusion is that the appearance of cosmological parameters as measured in the local universe is very recent i.e. the measurement of cosmological parameters at high redshift permits to distinguish between this model and other quintessence models .\nit is evident that the model presented here can not be believed before investigating many issues .\nthe first and one of the most important ones is the condensation of the scalar field .\none should determine the mass and the form of the potential and find the region of the parameter space that in a natural way can lead to a late condensation .\nthe other issue is that the value of @xmath8 for this type of matter can not be constant .\nthis can affect the evolution of halos , star formation rate , ionization of igm etc . and can be used to verify the model .\n"

    "article_text": "recent exciting results from the searches for high - redshift type ia supernov  ( sne ia ) have been interpreted as suggesting that there is indeed a cosmological constant and that the expansion of the universe is accelerating ( perlmutter 1999 and riess 1998 ) .\nthe results on the cosmology are robust in that they are independent of the value of the hubble parameter , @xmath4 , ( as they use redshift , @xmath5 ) and also of the local calibration of the sne ia luminosities ( as the distance modulus is used ) .\nthey do rest upon an underlying assumption that the local and global values of @xmath4 are the same ( so that the distance - redshift relationship does not change ) .    here\nwe examine how different the local value of @xmath4 must be from the global value in order to significantly change the cosmology derived from the fitting of high - redshift sne ia data to the hubble diagram .\na similar approach was taken by kim ( 1997 ) to fit data from the first 7 high - redshift sne ia between @xmath6 ; in this paper we extend that work with a much larger number of supernov  in the range @xmath7 .\n( it should also be noted that the data used by kim favoured an @xmath8 cosmology at the time . )\nthe idea that the local universe is atypical has been suggested by numerous authors ( see dekel 1994 for a review ) .\nhudson ( 1999 ) report evidence for a large scale bulk flow on scales possibly greater than 14000 km s@xmath9 .\nplionis & kolokotronis ( 1998 ) show that there may be contributions to the x - ray cluster dipole from beyond 16000 km s@xmath9 .\nlauer & postman ( 1994 ) and scaramella ( 1992 ) suggest the possibility of even larger density inhomogeneities out to a distance of 15000 - 30000 km s@xmath9 .\nphillips & turner ( 1998 ) see that near - ir galaxy counts out to @xmath10 are deficient which may be due to a local underdensity on such scales , implying that the local value of the hubble parameter @xmath4 is up to 30 per cent higher than the global value .\ntammann ( 1998 ) also sees a decrease in the value of @xmath4 out to 18000 km s@xmath9 of 7 per cent .    whilst these claims are not without their detractors it is clear that a body of work exists to suggest that the local value of @xmath4 may not be the same as the global value and\ncould be higher .\nsee turner , cen & ostriker ( 1992 ) for a detailed discussion of this topic .\nwe assume that the value of @xmath4 on scales greater than @xmath11 is equal to the global value , and then fit open and flat cosmologies to the high - redshift sne ia data , shifting the zero - point of the data to find the best fit to the various cosmologies .\nthe difference in zero - points between the local and high - redshift supernov  is then used to calculate the difference between the local and global values of the hubble parameter .    using the corrected data for 10 high - redshift sne ia presented in tables 5 and 6 of riess ( 1998 ) and for 40 supernova cosmology project ( scp ) high - redshift sne ia from table 1 of perlmutter ( 1999 ) we reconstruct the hubble diagrams . the shift in the local - to - global hubble parameter required to fit various flat and open cosmologies\nare then calculated using a @xmath12 fit , also finding the 95 per cent confidence limits .\nfigure 1 shows the required local - to - global ratio of the hubble parameter to fit the scp sne ia data .\nthe best fit when @xmath13 in fig .\n1(a ) is the well - known @xmath14 cosmology found by perlmutter ( 1999 ) .\nmore interestingly a variety of low @xmath2 open cosmologies are not rejected at the 95 per cent level even if @xmath13 . in order for an @xmath15 open cosmology to be the best fit to the data then @xmath16 is required .\nthe recovery of critical mass density cosmologies is more difficult .\nthey are rejected at greater than the 99 per cent level if @xmath17 and need a large ratio @xmath18 .\nthe data of riess ( 1998 ) was also examined and the fits are very similar to those presented in fig .\n1 although they are less significant due to the much lower number of data points .\ngenerally the riess data are slightly less consistent with a low @xmath2 open cosmology and @xmath8 critical cosmologies are ruled out at a higher confidence level , requiring a 1.2 to 1.3 @xmath19 ratio .\nto fit best a low @xmath2 open cosmology then the @xmath19 ratio must be 1.1 - 1.2 .\nif the local value of the hubble parameter is higher than the global value on scales of a few 100 @xmath20 mpc then the fitting of cosmological parameters to the high - redshift sne ia data of perlmutter ( 1999 ) and riess ( 1998 ) may be inappropriate .\npreviously popular cosmologies such as open or critical matter density universes with no cosmological constant may be acceptable if we live in a local underdensity . whilst large underdensities of scales up to 300 - 600 @xmath20 mpc are not expected from standard power spectra\n, there is some observational evidence that we may live in such an underdensity ( see section 2 ) , a possibility which is not ruled out by these results .\nit seems that is too early yet to abandon the traditional models .\n"

    "article_text": "fueled by the successes of current transit - observation incentives like kepler @xcite and corot @xcite the quest for discovering the first earth - twin has lead to a considerable cross - disciplinary interest in the interplay between stellar and planetary properties to produce habitable worlds .\neven - though opinions differ on what exactly to look for in a system harboring a terrestrial planet in order to declare it habitable ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , the classical assumption investigated by @xcite , i.e. the capacity for water to stay liquid on the planet s surface , may still be considered a prerequisite for the development and sustainability of complex life as we know it @xcite .\nthis entails restrictions on planetological characteristics , such as mass , atmospheric and bulk composition , and sets limits to the host star s activity as well as radiation properties @xcite .\ndynamical considerations are of equal importance , since changes in orbital stability , or extreme variations in insolation due to large planetary eccentricities ( @xmath0 ) may also result in a hostile environment @xcite .\nit is therefore only natural that one would look for a copy of our solar system , when searching for habitable worlds .\nyet , the study of exoplanetary systems so far has clearly shown that a broader perspective is required .\nin fact , up to 70% of all stellar systems in our galaxy may not be single but multi - stellar systems ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .\ntogether with the approximately 60 planets that have already been discovered in systems harboring two stars @xcite this suggests that binary and multiple star systems should not be ignored in the search for habitable worlds .\ninvestigations of environments that permit planetary formation in binary star systems have progressed rapidly over the last decade ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . even -\nthough important questions regarding the early phases of planet formation in binary star systems - especially the transition from planetesimal to planetary embryos - still remain to be answered , late stage formation scenarios for terrestrial planets in such environments are available @xcite . since previous studies did consider the extent of the classical habitable zone ( khz ) to be purely a function of the primary star s luminosity and spectral type as introduced by @xcite ( hereafter kwr93 ) , we aim to refine this definition to encompass the gravitational and radiative influence of a second star .\nthis article is structured as follows : after a short recapitulation of the main radiative aspects of habitability as defined in kwr93 section [ sec : bp ] introduces three exemplary binary - planet configurations , which will serve as test - cases for habitability considerations .\nsection [ sec : stab ] briefly mentions the dynamical requirements which binary - planet configurations have to fulfill in order to ensure system stability . in section [ sec : sec ] the maximum radiative influence of the second star on a terrestrial planet in the primary s hz is estimated and compared to actual insolation simulations .\nthe occurring differences are being investigated in the following section . finally , generalized , analytical estimates are developed and compared to numerical simulations in sections [ sec : ana ] & [ sec : num ] , and the results concerning the behavior of hzs in binary star systems are presented in section [ sec : res ] .\na discussion of the results concludes this article .\nccc f0 & 1.90 & 0.46 + g2 & 1.41 & 0.36 + m0 & 1.05 & 0.27    apart from planetological and dynamical aspects , the insolation a terrestrial planet receives from its host star is naturally the main driver determining the extent of the hz . when considering planets within a binary star system it is therefore important to track the combined radiation of both stars arriving at the planet .\nkwr93 showed that not only the sheer amount of insolation , but also the spectral distribution is essential to estimate limiting values for atmospheric collapse . in order to model the impact of diverse stellar spectral classes on an earth - like planet s atmosphere ,\nkwr93 introduced so - called effective radiation values .\nthese measure the relative impact a comparable amount of radiation ( e.g. 1360 @xmath1 $ ] ) with different spectral properties has on a planet s atmosphere . taking the effects of different stellar spectra into account is especially important in binary star systems with different stellar components\n[ tab2 ] reproduces the effective radiation values for the inner ( runaway greenhouse ) and outer ( maximum greenhouse ) edge of a single star s hz as given in kwr93 .\nnotice how the onset of runaway greenhouse effects requires almost twice as much radiation for a spectral distribution akin to f0 class stars compared to m0 spectral types .\neven though @xcite assume similar effective radiation values for m and k spectral classes , actual calculations have only been done for f0 , g2 and m0 zams stars .\nfor this reason , we first investigate the following three stellar configurations :\n"
