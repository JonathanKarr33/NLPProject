    "gpt_abstract": "This paper presents an investigation into the temporal properties of supergiant fast X-ray transients (SFXTs), a subclass of high mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs). The study utilizes observational data from IBIS public archive to analyze the waiting time between consecutive X-ray flares and the duration of the brightest phase of the outbursts. The authors found that there is a correlation between the energy emitted during SFXT outbursts and the duration of the outbursts, which is attributed to the fractal structure of the OB-supergiant winds. The findings provide insights into the physical processes responsible for SFXT outbursts and shed light on the nature of these transients. The study has implications for the understanding of accretion in high mass X-ray binaries."

    "abstract_text": " the automatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora is an important sub - task of text mining .   it can be seen as a special case of string alignment , where a text chunk is aligned with an acronym .   alternative alignments have different cost , and ideally the least costly one should give the correct meaning of the acronym .      we show how this approach can be implemented by means of a 3-tape weighted finite - state machine ( 3-wfsm ) which reads a text chunk on tape 1 and an acronym on tape 2 , and generates all alternative alignments on tape 3 .   the 3-wfsm can be automatically generated from a simple regular expression .   no additional algorithms are required at any stage .   our 3-wfsm has a size of 27 states and 64 transitions , and finds the best analysis of an acronym in a few milliseconds .

    "gpt_abstract": "This paper discusses the automatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora, which is an important sub-task of text mining. The paper outlines the techniques and approaches used in acronym-meaning extraction, including string alignment, heuristic algorithms, and finite-state machines. It presents a detailed description of the 3-tape weighted finite-state machine (3-wfsm) used for alignment-based approach to acronym-meaning extraction, which is implemented using clear regular expressions. \nThe paper describes the steps involved in generating and applying the 3-wfsm, the compilation of various weighted finite-state machines, and the final acronym-meaning extraction process using cost assignment to different operations. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach through examples and testing, showing that the best analysis for an acronym can be obtained in just a few milliseconds. The paper also references existing work and publications on related topics."
