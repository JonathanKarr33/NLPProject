    "article_text_summary": " new beryllium and oxygen abundances are presented for a sample of slightly evolved f - type stars of the old disk with available lithium measurements .   a large scatter is found in the beryllium abundances , which shows no clear correlation with stellar mass . a small dispersion is observed in the oxygen abundances , which appear to be correlated with increasing stellar mass .   assuming that beryllium could have been produced during big bang nucleosynthesis in the same way as boron with a well determined primordial abundance , the correlation of beryllium with lithium and the correlation of both elements with stellar mass can be used to discriminate between different mechanisms proposed to explain the `` li gap '' observed in old f - type stars .   none of the theoretical oxygen abundance predictions reproduces the observed values , which are much larger than the predictions from theoretical c and o radiative accelerations computed by different authors .   it is shown that there is no qualitative change in the distribution of beryllium or oxygen abundances when plotted against stellar mass instead of against effective temperature , indicating that the mechanism responsible for the fragility - related abundance surface pattern cannot be associated exclusively with the stellar structure .   internal gravity waves capable of inducing a mixing of material in the stellar interior are proposed as a possible mechanism ( together with a link to the stellar rotational velocity able to modify the wave production and/or efficiency ) which is able to account for the observed abundances .   a similar formalism proposed previously was found not to predict the large beryllium depletions observed .
