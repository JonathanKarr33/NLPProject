    "article_text_summary": "We present _ spitzer space telescope _ phase - curve observations of the eccentric hot jupiter hd  80606  b .   the observations were obtained in the 4.5 and 8.0  @xmath18 m bandpasses and cover the planet s periastron passage .   we detect the occultation of the planet and find that the flux from the planet increases by a factor of @xmath17 between apoastron and periastron .   the occultation of the planet allows us to establish a baseline stellar flux and to demonstrate that the planet is not radiating strongly enough to be detected at the start of the 4.5-@xmath18 m time series .   the final 30 hours of the time series show no evidence of any resurgence of flux from the planet .   we analyze the phase - curve data using a simple energy - conserving model of the planet s global atmospheric response to the time - dependent stellar flux .   the model assumes that the photometry is unaffected by any advective hydrodynamical response , and that the planet has a uniform global temperature , @xmath22 , 50 hrs prior to its periastron passage .   we find that the global temperature of the probed atmospheric layers increases rapidly from @xmath2k to 1400k during the periastron passage .   the shape of the planetary fluxes as a function of time  including the shift of the peak flux from periastron passage and overall symmetry of the response  implies that the photospheric layers at 4.5 and 8  @xmath18 m absorb @xmath47 and @xmath48% of the incoming stellar flux and have a radiative timescales of 4.04@xmath49 and 1.28@xmath50 hours , respectively .   the hemisphere - averaged brightness temperatures and the parameter estimates for the 4.5 and 8  @xmath18 m photospheres are consistent at the 1-sigma level suggesting significant overlap in the atmospheric pressure levels probed by each bandpass .   the atmospheric properties estimated near the 4.5 and 8.0  @xmath18 m photospheres suggest that pressures near the @xmath1110 - 100  mbar and @xmath51 level in the optical are being probed by these bandpasses .   the marginal brightness through the bulk of the orbit implies either the presence of significant cloud coverage that suppresses the planet s observable thermal emission , similarly to @xcite , or a marginal thermal emission .   assuming hd  80606  b s atmosphere to be cloud free , this implies that hd  80606  b s atmosphere undergoes a transient thermal inversion during the periastron passage as predicted in @xcite .   the stefan - boltzmann law implies a tidal luminosity @xmath52 w. assuming that the tidal heat is primarily dissipated in the deep interior and dominates other internal heat sources , this value can be used to place an upper limit on the planet s tidal quality factor @xmath53 , through the relation @xcite : @xmath54 giving @xmath55 .   for example , estimates of the tidal quality factor of jupiter give @xmath56 , based on measurements of the secular accelerations of the jovian satellites @xcite .   a comparatively low rate of tidal energy dissipation within hd  80606  b would then be consistent with it having retained a large eccentricity and a large rotation period in the face of billions of years of tidal evolution .   our analysis of _ spitzer _ s phase curve data for hd  80606  b has provided critical insights into the planet s atmospheric and interior properties .   data analysis techniques and our understanding of systematics for _ spitzer _ observations have greatly improved since the original reduction of the 8-@xmath18 m data by @xcite , which provided the first estimate for radiative timescales in hot jupiter atmosphere .   our new estimates of the radiative timescales are consistent with @xcite and support inefficient transport of energy from the dayside to the nightside of the planet  the observations presented here do not provide further constraints on hd  80606  b s atmospheric dynamics .   the long temporal baseline of the 4.5-@xmath18 m data also allowed for constrains on the internal temperature of hd  80606  b , which together with those on its rotation period have challenged assumptions generally made on tidal dissipation in hot jupiters .   although it is plausible that additional processes such as cloud formation play a role in shaping hd  80606  b s phase - curve , the planet s response near periastron passage will be dominated by radiative processes that are well described by our simple physical model .   a transient thermal inversion will form near the probed photospheres ( above any cloud decks ) that will dominate the planetary flux signal from which the absorptivity , radiative timescale , and rotation rate were derived .   in order to get further insights into hd  80606  b s atmospheric and formation processes , complementary observations at shorter and longer wavelengths are required to constrain the extent to which scattering and emission processes are shaping its flux near periastron .   this work is based on observations made with the _ spitzer space telescope _ , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract to nasa .

We apply the method to the case of xuv photons interacting with solid aluminum targets. We then discuss the case of xuv photons delivered by the free electron laser facility at desy-hamburg (flash) scattering on liquid hydrogen at near solid density. The influence of the density and temperature profiles on the scattering signal is discussed. We show that the density and temperature profiles can be inferred from the scattering spectrum.

The interferometric complex field coherence time of the reflected GPS signal is shown to correlate well with the ratio of mean wave period to significant wave height, as predicted by a first-order model. A semi-empirical algorithm for sea surface height is also derived. The results are compared to wind speed and buoy observables. "

    "article_text_summary": "we report on x - ray and optical observations in the field of one of the unidentified galactic gamma - ray sources with a hard gamma - ray spectrum , 2eg  j0635 + 0521 .  using the _ satellite italiano per astronomia x _ ( bepposax ) , we observed a field centered on a region of unusually high x - ray hardness and brightness found in an x - ray survey of the monoceros supernova remnant ( leahy , naranan , & singh 1986 ) and located within the error box of the egret source 2eg  j0635 + 0521 ( thompson et al . 1996 ) .  the field of view of the bepposax narrow field instruments covered approximately half of the error box of 2eg  j0635 + 0521 .  the x - ray images from the lecs and the mecs 2 and 3 detectors reveal a single point source located at ra = @xmath2 , dec = @xmath3 ( j2000 ) .  this source lies within the error box of 2eg  j0635 + 0521 ( see figure  1 ) and near the peak of the gamma - ray emission as reconstructed by jaffe et al .  the image is consistent with that of a single point source , see fig .  the x - ray spectrum of the source is quite hard with a spectral index near 1.5 and significant emission detected out to 40  kev .  shown in figure  2 are data from the lecs , the combined mecs 2 and 3 , and the pds .  we used an extraction radius of 2 for the mecs and 4 for the lecs , the standard background files , and response matrixes calculated for the source position 3 off - axis .  the x - ray spectrum from all the instruments can be fitted with a simple powerlaw model with absorption .  the unabsorbed flux from the source is @xmath7 in the 2 - 10  kev band .  the 90% confidence lower bound on the cutoff energy is 37  kev .  we also fitted a raymond - smith model spectrum which gave a worse fit @xmath9 and an unphysically high temperature , @xmath10 .  we searched for pulsations in the x - ray data over a period range from 0.030  s to 1000  s. we found no significant pulsed signal .  from the period with the highest single trial significance , we place an upper limit on the pulsed fraction of 26% .  the continuum of the timing power spectrum is consistent with the poisson level for frequencies above 0.002  hz .  this field was previously viewed with the einstein ipc ( region 3 in leahy et al . 1986 ) .  the source was not detected with einstein because , we now know , it fell on a strongback arm .  the position of sax  j0635 + 0533 falls @xmath11 off axis in this image , where the point - spread function is significantly degraded .  folding the spectrum of sax  j0635 + 0533 through the _ rosat _ response , we find that the predicted number of counts is roughly consistent with the number observed .  in order to identify the optical counterpart of sax  j0635 + 0533 , we obtained optical spectra of seven stars within and around the @xmath12 radius error circle on 1997 dec . 10 , using the 2.4  m hiltner telescope of the mdm observatory .  the spectra covered the wavelength range 45007500    at 4    resolution .  the brightest star within the error circle ( figure  3 ) is the only one with broad emission lines and other spectral features that are characteristic of a reddened be star .  be stars are often hard x - ray sources because of emission from an unseen compact companion such as a neutron star .  this star is listed in the usno a1.0 astrometric catalog of the palomar observatory sky survey ( monet et al . 1996 ) .  there is no 20  cm radio source present at this position in the nvss catalog ( condon et al . 1998 ) .  additional optical spectra were obtained with the goldcam spectrograph on the kpno 2.1  m telescope on 1998 january 28 , 29 , and 30 .  on the first two nights the spectra covered the wavelength range 38677516    with a resolution of 56   , while on the third night the spectra covered the range 55488613    with a resolution of 4   .  three sequences of 300  s exposures were taken on each night ( at the beginning middle , and end of the night ) , yielding a total of 39 spectra .  all of the spectra obtained are consistent with each other in continuum flux and emission - line properties .  the mean of several of the kpno spectra is shown in figure  4 , and their emission - line properties are listed in table  1 .  it can be fitted well by the sum of a broad and a narrow gaussian .  a 300  s exposure on sax  j0635 + 0533 was obtained by goeff marcy using the hires instrument ( vogt et al . 1994 ) .  figure  5 shows the profiles of h@xmath22 and he  i  @xmath235876 , after normalizing them by the local continuum level and smoothing with a 14  km  s@xmath20 running boxcar filter .  thus it appears that the narrow component identified in the moderate - resolution spectra as having fwhm @xmath26  km  s@xmath20 is actually resolved into a disk - like profile , similar to what is seen in the be star x - ray transient a0535 + 26 by clark et al .  ( 1998 ) , and attributed by them to a circumstellar disk around the be star .  the individual kpno spectra were used to search for radial velocity variations of the h@xmath19 line over the three nights , but no significant variations were found .  the scatter in the measured velocities appears to be random , and defines an upper limit to the real radial velocity variations on this time scale of 30  km  s@xmath20 .  the _ observed _ johnson magnitudes ( johnson & morgan 1951 ) measured from the mean spectrum of figure  4 are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 .  absorption in many diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) is apparent in figure  4 , and the equivalent widths of these can be used to estimate reddening and distance .  in addition to the ews , the depth of the @xmath30 feature was also measured to be 13% below the continuum ( this quantity is a reddening indicator in addition to the ew ) .  the most extensive work is that of herbig ( 1975 ) who studied the correlation of the ews of many dibs with reddening .  wampler ( 1963 , 1966 ) noted that the calibration of the @xmath30 feature as a reddening indicator depends on galactic longitude .  more recently , tg & schmidt - kaler ( 1981 ) also investigated this issue and came up with their own calibration for the depth of the @xmath30 feature .  we estimated the extinction @xmath31 to sax  j0635 + 0533 using each of these calibrations , and adopted a mean value of @xmath32 , where the uncertainty corresponds to the dispersion among different calibrations .  the mon  ob2 association is a cluster of massive stars at a distance of 1620  pc ( garmany & stencel 1992 ) , and within @xmath35 of sax  j0635 + 0533 .  the h  i column densities to 11 stars in this cluster have been measured with iue using lyman @xmath19 absorption and are in the range @xmath36 ( diplas & savage 1984 ) .  thus we can be confident that sax  j0635 + 533 is no closer than the 1620  pc distance to mon ob2 .  the mean column density to the 11 stars is @xmath39 .  if we assume that 0.8 mag / kpc is a typical value along the line of sight , the distance to sax  j0635 + 533 is probably not further than 5  kpc .  1992 ) , which is larger than the column density estimated for sax  j0635 + 0533 from interstellar absorption .  thus , we regard the estimated extinction from the dibs as compatible with the 21  cm h  i column , while the larger x - ray measured value , @xmath44  @xmath38 , implies that there must be some circumstellar gas that is responsible for the extra x - ray absorption .  we note that the emission - line ratio of h@xmath19/h@xmath22 can be used with recombination theory to derive an upper limit to @xmath31 of 1.4 , and that this upper limit is also well below the x - ray measured column .  for a distance range of 2.55 kpc , the absolute visual magnitude would be in the range @xmath48 to @xmath49 , and the stellar classification in the range b2v to b1iii .  assuming 200 be / x - ray binaries within 5  kpc ( rappaport & van den heuvel 1982 ) distributed uniformly in galactic longitude and in a latitude distribution with an rms width of @xmath50 , we estimate there is a 4% chance of finding a spurious overlap of a be / x - ray binary in an error box the size of that for 2eg  j0635 + 0521 .  in addition , both be / x - ray binaries and the low - latitude egret sources are preferentially found near ob associations ( kaaret & cottam 1996 ) .  this may suggest that some of the unidentified egret sources are , in fact , associated with be / x - ray binaries .  while identification of sax  j0635 + 0533 and its optical counterpart with 2eg  j0635 + 0521 must remain tentative awaiting an improved gamma - ray position or detection of periodicity in both x - rays and gamma - rays , the positional coincidence and the hard spectrum of the x - ray source are suggestive and here we entertain some speculations based on the possible identification .  assuming the association of the x - ray source sax  j0635 + 0533 with the optical counterpart discussed above and with 2eg  j0635 + 0521 , allows us to find the luminosity of the source based on the optical distance estimate .  the 210 kev x - ray luminosity would be @xmath51 and the gamma - ray luminosity for 0.15  gev would be @xmath52 , both assuming isotropic emission .  if the identification is correct , then the source would be a gamma - ray emitting x - ray binary .  it is possible that the binary contains a neutron star and that both the x - ray and gamma - ray emission are magnetospheric pulsar emission .  if the binary is wide , as is tentatively suggested by our non - detection of radial velocity variations , then the pulsar emission may be be relatively uninfluenced by the presence of the companion star .  the ratio of x - ray to gamma - ray flux is consistent with those of `` vela - like '' pulsars .  the power - law x - ray spectrum with photon index near 1.5 is similar to that of most isolated gamma - ray pulsars above 2  kev ( wang et al . 1998 ) .  the gamma - ray flux is constant over 14 different observations ( mclaughlin et al . 1996 ) .  ( 1996 ) as one of only eight unidentified galactic gamma - ray sources with energy spectra sufficiently hard to be pulsar candidates .  alternatively , either the x - ray emission , gamma - ray emission , or both may arise from interaction of the energetic particle wind from the pulsar with the wind or the radiation from the companion .  such mechanisms have been suggested for be / millisecond radio pulsar binary psr  j1259 - 63 and the variable radio be / x - ray binary system lsi  61@xmath54  303 .  in psr  j1259 - 63 , emission up to 200  kev is thought to arise from a shock interaction of the energetic particle wind from a pulsar with the wind from the be - star ( grove et al . 1995 ) .  however , psr  j1259 - 63 was not detected by egret ( tavani et al . 1996 ) and the x - ray emission is highly variable .  it is possible that the shock acceleration mechanism could operate to higher energies if the shock region is less compact than that of psr  j1259 - 63 at periastron ( tavani & arons 1997 ) .  the gamma - ray source 2cg  135 + 01 has long had a tentative association with the unusually variable radio source and be / x - ray binary lsi  61@xmath54  303 ( gregory & taylor 1978 ; for recent work see strickman et al . 1998 ) .  it has been suggested ( maraschi & treves 1981 ) that the source contains a young pulsar and that the gamma - rays arise from inverse - compton scattering of the optical photons from the b - star in the relativistic wind from the pulsar at the boundary between the pulsar wind and the stellar wind .  finally , it may be that the emission is powered not by rotation of a neutron star , but rather by accretion .  the recently reported detection of gev pulsations from cen  x-3 with a frequency equal to that detected contemporaneously in x - rays ( vestrand , sreekumar , & mori 1997 ) , albeit not with an outstandingly high significance , suggests the possibility that 2eg  j0635 + 0521 could be an accretion powered system .  if sax  j0635 + 0533 is similar to cen  x-3 , the x - ray emission would be from accretion and should be pulsed .  however , the lower bound we obtained for the exponential cutoff energy of the x - ray spectrum is significantly higher than the cutoffs typically found in high - mass x - ray binaries ( white , swank , & holt 1983 ) and would be more suggestive of either a low magnetic field neutron star or a black hole .  identification of sax  j0635 + 0533 with the gamma - ray source 2eg  j0635 + 0521 would argue against interpreting the gamma - ray emission as due to cosmic - ray production via shock acceleration in the supernova remnant ( esposito et al . 1996 ) .  we note that we detect no diffuse hard x - ray emission in the bepposax data .  possible ways to strength the identification of the x - ray / optical source and the gamma - ray source would be to detect a periodicity in the x - ray , optical , or radio which could then be detected in gamma - rays or to extend the x - ray spectrum and join it to the gamma - ray spectrum .  finally , if the gamma - ray emission extends to higher energies , an improved gamma - ray position may be obtained from a ground - based tev telescope such as the whipple .  we thank fabrizio fiore and the sax data center for assistance with the sax data .  m.  e. acknowledges support from hubble fellowship grant hf-01068.01 - 94a from space telescope science institute , which is operated for nasa by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc ."

a sign change can lead to a cancellation in the integral @xmath63 ) .   the same argument applies to non - lrs models , and generally in bianchi models of all types , where there are sign changes in the shear @xcite .   however , complications in the analysis can arise because there may be no exactly isotropic surface to base the calculation on .   in addition , obtaining constraints based upon the octopole may also pose problems , since @xmath63 may be a poor approximation for the octopole .   the wmap data provide some of the most accurate measurements yet of the cmb and contribute to high accuracy determinations of cosmological parameters @xcite .   however , there are several studies that show that at large scales , the cmb is not statistically isotropic and gaussian @xcite .   in @xcite , a possible detection of a correlation between several independently discovered anomalies in the cmb sky measured by the wmap data and a bianchi type vii@xmath15 template @xcite was reported .   the predictions for the cmb anisotropy patterns arising in bianchi type vii@xmath15 universes which include a dark energy component were presented in @xcite , and it was found that including a term @xmath64 , can lead to the same observed structure as in the best - fit bianchi type vii@xmath15 model of @xcite .   although the best - fit bianchi type vii@xmath15 model is not compatible with measured cosmological parameters , it was shown that removing a bianchi component from the wmap initial data release can account for several large angular scale anomalies and yield a corrected sky that is statistically isotropic .   it was concluded that in the absence of an unknown systematic effect which could explain both the anomalies and the correlation , the wmap data require an addition to the standard cosmological model that resembles the bianchi morphology @xcite .   we have only discussed orthogonal spatially homogeneous models here .   expanding sh perfect fluid cosmological models with a constant equation of state parameter @xmath65 with a non - geodesic ` tilting ' fluid congruence were studied in @xcite .   it was shown that for stiff equations of state the tilt can give rise to an effective quintessential , or even phantom - like , equation of state .   more importantly , it is of interest to investigate the effect of tilt on cmb radiation observations from the perspective of the observers moving with the fluid matter congruence and , in particular , to determine whether the tilt can significantly affect the constraints on the shear in sh models ."

The fundamental plane obtained from our data and the cluster ellipticals at intermediate redshift is well defined with a scatter of 0.13 in log sigma with respect to the local relation. The Kormendy relation between sb and log r for all the intermediate redshift data shows an offset of 0.71 magnitudes in surface brightness with respect to the Coma ellipticals, in agreement with what is found using the fundamental plane.

    "article_text_summary": "We present an analysis of the projected galaxy pair UGC 5041, following the approach of White and Keel (1992). The foreground galaxy is a highly inclined Sc at 2200 km/s, with a background galaxy at 2800 km/s, whose center is projected at a mean distance of 21 (or 28) kpc from UGC 5041's center. We present another case study, to complement the existing small set of studies already in the literature (White and Keel 1992 and Bernstein et al. 1997), because the particular galaxy pair, the observations and analysis differ in several relevant aspects: * the background galaxy behind UGC 5041 was found only in H-band images (Gary Bernstein, private communication). Hence, the galaxy pair is subject to different selection biases than optically selected pairs and has the potential to yield an optical depth estimate of 0.3. * Given the relatively small projected separation ( 10 ) and qualitatively high optical depths (see also NGC 3314, Keel 1983), our analysis is based solely on near-IR observations (H and I) . * From the observations we calculate the _ area-weighted optical depth distribution _ , p(v), near the half-light radius of the foreground disk This is the most immediately relevant quantity for assessing the extinction statistics of background sources. * We apply the derived p(v) to explore the under-representation of QSOs lensed by spiral galaxies and of QSOs with low redshift damped Ly- absorption. In  2 we describe the data reduction and analysis. In  3 we describe the estimates of the optical depth distribution and its errors; in  4 we discuss the implications of this estimate and in  5 we present the conclusions. The H-band (1.6 m) images were taken on September 19, 1996 at the 2.3 m Bok telescope on Kitt Peak using the 256x256 IRCAM with a scale of 0.58/pixel. The data were taken by integrating on the object for 60 seconds, shifting to the sky (60 off-set) for 60 seconds, then returning to the galaxy and repeating the procedure. Each telescope dither was to a slightly different part of the sky near the object. The total integration time on the galaxy pair was 3600 sec (60 object-sky image pairs). In the subsequent analysis, eleven of the final images were discarded, because crucial portions of the image were corrupted by bad pixels. The bias and dark frames were subtracted from all galaxy and sky frames. Subsequently, the two sky flats bracketing an object image were averaged, normalized and used to flatfield the interleafing galaxy image. Reduced and flux-calibrated I-band(7800) and the B-band(4400) CCD images of UGC5041 were kindly provided by Gary Bernstein. They were originally taken on February 27 and 29, 1992, respectively, at the 2.3 m Bok telescope on Kitt Peak. Since the optical images had different pixel scales (0.3/pixel), the H-band image need to be de-magnified and aligned. All photon-noise and flux-calibration errors were propagated throughout these steps, but in the end found to be negligible compared to the systematic modeling uncertainties discussed below. Figure 1 shows the resulting images in B, I and H. It is apparent that in the B-band the extinction is high, for the most part obscuring the background galaxy. Only one bright region is shining through (in the upper left part of the foreground galaxy), explaining why this galaxy pair was never found in optical surveys. Qualitatively, the I-band image hints at 0.3, as the dust extinction is obvious, but not overwhelming. The rightmost panel of Figure 1 shows that dust extinction effects in the H-band are subtle. However, we do not neglect the H-band extinction. With the three images aligned, scaled, and flux-calibrated we can proceed to estimate the optical depths in the foreground galaxy. The recorded images are composed of light from the foreground galaxy and of attenuated light from the background galaxy. The equation for radiative transfer in this case is simply (see also WK92) where denotes the wavelength of the observations, and x the image position. (1) One can see that as a first step we must subtract the foreground galaxy light, , at each wavelength in the region where the two galaxies overlap. Since the edge-on background galaxy is an almost linear feature, an estimate of the foreground galaxy light was made by interpolating the adjacent foreground light across it. This fit was then subtracted from the overlapping region, and the associated errors were an important source of uncertainty in the final optical depth determination. Indeed, the HII regions and the spiral arms in the foreground galaxy rendered the B-band image too irregular to get an accurate estimate for the fit. Therefore, the B-band data was not used in the subsequent analysis. The H-band image on the other hand, had little error in subtracting out the foreground light, because the foreground galaxy contributed little to the light in the overlapping region to begin with. To get an independent error estimate for we analyzed the opposite side of the foreground galaxy, where there are no over-lapping galaxies, and carried out the same interpolation The residuals provide us with an accuracy estimate of in I for the foreground subtraction. Next the corrected background light, , should be divided by an estimate of its _un_extincted value, , to solve for . Although direct estimates of are unknown, because we can not neglect the foreground extinction even in the H-band. Fortunately, the intrinsic I-H color of highly inclined disk galaxies is quite uniform. For example, Bernstein et al (1994) find I-H=1.880.08 magnitudes for their sample of 21 spirals, with 2 outlier galaxies that are bluer by 0.4 magnitudes than the mean. Hence, we have a very good guess of the background galaxy s color in absence of the foreground galaxy. By dividing the observed I-H flux ratio by the un-extincted, or intrinsic, value, we can estimate directly via to obtain a well defined map of we created a mask that isolated the image regions of significant background galaxy flux in H. The pixel values in the masked ratio-image can then be converted into a histogram of , which is shown in Figure 2. Our data span a range of 10 kpc in the plane of the foreground galaxy, but no systematic radial variation of the extinction was found. Our data provide a direct estimate of the differential extinction probability distribution . For broader applications it would be useful to correct this value to face-on and to convert it to estimates of . The radial range (10 to 20 kpc) covered by our estimate of is quite limited, but of particular interest. Second, because the Einstein ring radius for distant galaxies is 10 kpc(e.g. As a first step and benchmark, we estimate by assuming an extinction curve, , similar to the Milky Way s, (e.g. Under this assumption the face-on value of is given by where (Mathis 1990). The inclination angle, i, of the foreground galaxy was found by fitting isophotes. Assuming an edge-on axis ratio of 0.19 for UGC 5041 s stellar disk we find an inclination angle of ; the inclination error turned out to be negligible in the subsequent analysis. A pixel-to-pixel histogram of the face-on optical extinction, , derived under these assumptions is shown in Figure 3. In converting to we assumed so far that the extinction curve in the foreground galaxy was similar to the Milky Way s. However, the IR extinction was derived over an extended region of the foreground galaxy, as each pixel subtends on a side at a distance of 28mpc. In this section we investigate how much dust inhomogeneities affect our estimates of by using a simple model to derive an effective coefficient, , for clumpy extinction. Following B97 we consider an area A in the foreground galaxy, covered by one pixel, within which a fraction is covered by material with an times greater extinction curve than the rest of the area. If is set to zero in eq 6 then the measured, or effective, extinction will be equal to the mean. Qualitatively the situation differs most for , where we obtain for a ratio of optical depths, x . The histogram for , the clumpy extinction case, is shown by the dotted lines in Figure 2. The mean extinction in V has increased from 0.34 to 0.41, with a commensurate increase of the dispersion. Optical depths through galaxy disks have been derived several ways by different authors (Keel 1983, Keel and White 1995, James and Puxley 1995, B97). Each analysis had to rely on different sets of assumption, such as intrinsic galaxy symmetry (WK92, B97), _case B_ recombination ratios for Balmer lines (James and Puxley 1995), and intrinsic near-IR colors of galaxies (this paper). James and Puxley (1995) found quite high extinction values from analyzing H/H ratios, seen though the center of NGC3314. These values could be due to the small impact parameters of the probed lines of sight, or because the extinction intrinsic to the HII regions has been under-corrected. WK92 and B97 have estimated extinction by broad-band photometric methods, WK92 using CCD data, B97 using data that extend to 2 m. Referring all extinction values to face-on and the B-band, we find a mean of for UGC 5041 at using our clumpy model, which has an effective extinction curve similar to B97. Keel and White (1995) list at somewhat larger radii, and B97 find in an inter-arm region at . B97 also find in the dust-lanes near the arms, for which detailed case studies of nearby galaxies (e.g. , Elmegreen 1980 and Rix and Rieke 1993) have already shown that . Even though we have analyzed a purely infrared-selected pair of galaxies, and have based our analysis on near-IR data, it appears that our results are quite consistent with the optical analyses, implying that the basic result of semi-transparent disks is not simply a selection effect. As mentioned above, dust in foreground galaxies will dim and redden distant background objects, such as QSOs, that appear in close projection. Here we show how to use to estimate the first effect, focusing on optically selected quasars that lie within @xmath83 @xmath84 kpc of galaxies, such as QSOs lensed by spiral galaxies, or QSOs with low-redshift damped Ly- absorption. The radial range (10 to 20 kpc covered by our estimate of is quite limited, but of particular interest. We take from Peterson (1997, p. 174) the integrated number magnitude relation for quasars brighter than : for objects whose light passes through a foreground galaxy, the magnitude limit of any survey is effectively , where is the optical depth at the wavelength of the survey. Given a probability distribution we would expect such sources to be under-represented by a factor of : as Figure 3 shows is well approximated by which leads to and for the derived values of and , and , this results in and , respectively. Hence the chance of finding lensed of damped Ly- absorbed quasars (with ) in such close projection ( kpc) to spiral disks is suppressed by about a factor of two due to dust extinction, in good agreement with the independent estimate based on the Milky Way gas-to-dust ratio by Perna, Loeb and Bartelmann (1997). We have presented and analyzed H, I and B band images of the projected galaxy pair UGC 5041, in order to explore the distribution of dust extinction that light suffers while crossing the highly inclined foreground galaxy disk. This galaxy pair is completely obscured in the optical, and hence could have lead to ; this system also provides optical depth constraints at quite small impact parameters. After removing the light contribution from the foreground galaxy, we compared, pixel by pixel, the observed I-H color of the (extincted) background galaxy to its expected intrinsic I-H color, which can be estimated to 0.3 mag. This comparison resulted in a direct estimate of the distribution of , with . For a homogeneous dust distribution this translates into a face-on V-band optical depth of , for clumpy dust this corresponds to , with dispersion of and in . Despite the different selection criteria (which would have permitted to arrive at much higher optical depths) and an analysis based solely on near-IR data, these optical depths are consistent with the values found by WK92 and B97, and corroborate that generically in nearby galaxy disks. Using the derived distribution of , we estimated by how much quasars in close projection ( kpc) are under-represented in optically selected, flux-limited samples ( ) , and found a deficit by a factor of two due to dust extinction. As in many other analyses, the limited spatial resolution, which leads to averaging over areas of differing extinction is an important limitation."

    "article_text_summary": "We report the first high resolution radio observation of the inner PSR B1951+32 plerion using MERLIN at L band. We have resolved both the pulsar and apparent fine structure within the `hot spot' identified at lower resolution and believed to be a consequence of the pulsar wind interacting with swept up ISM/SNR material. Combined, these data indicate that the previously identified optical `knot' of synchrotron emission extends behind the pulsar, along a line that bisects the shock front emission. The dimensions of the optical knot and the VLA determined proper motion argue for a synchrotron cooling time that is consistent with particle replenishment from the pulsar wind. The formation of the knot can also be attributed to the mechanisms outlined in Lou (1998) with the interaction of MHD wind streams, whilst the knot's luminosity can be maintained by particle injection from the pulsar wind. Variations in the knot's luminosity and morphology are anticipated as successive quasi-periodic disturbances emanate from the pulsar. This being so it argues for a fundamentally dynamical nature to the observed synchrotron knot which may only be really discernible using future HST or ground-based adaptive optics observations. Finally, the MERLIN data definitively rules out the putative optical counterparts to PSR B1951+32 suggested by Butler et al. (2004), and provides an unambiguous error box with which to assist future high time resolution searches."

    "article_text_summary": "We present deep emission-line images and long-slit spectra of the early-type spiral galaxy NGC 1482. The images were obtained using the Taurus Tunable Filter (TTF) on the 3.9 m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The long-slit spectra were obtained using the Dual-Beam Spectrograph (DBS) on the 2.3 m telescope at the Mount Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories. The TTF images reveal a remarkable hourglass-shaped structure of ionized gas extending at least 1.5 kpc above and below the disk of the galaxy. The [N II]/H\u03b1 ratio map of NGC 1482 shows that the excitation of the gas in the hourglass is dominated by shocks. The long-slit spectra confirm that the kinematics of the line-emitting gas are consistent with a large-scale galactic wind. The mass outflow rate is estimated to be 3.6 x 10^23 g s^-1, and the time-averaged kinetic energy injection rate is 1 x 10^39 erg s^-1. We discuss the implications of these results for the origin of the warm ionized gas on the outskirts of galaxies and for the detection of galactic winds in starburst galaxies."

    "article_text_summary": "We investigate the thermal evolution of neutron stars with the nuclear equations of state (EOSs) including hyperons or kaons. We use non-relativistic nuclear models to construct nucleonic degrees of freedom and employ non-relativistic hyperon potential models for \u039bN and \u03a3N interactions. We combine non-relativistic nuclear models and SU(3) non-linear chiral model for the description of kaon interactions. For the cooling calculation, in addition to the standard cooling process, we include direct Urca processes for both nucleons and hyperons and the neutrino emission caused by the condensed kaons. We neglect the nucleon superfluidity effects because its contribution is not crucial in explaining the observations once the nucleon direct Urca process sets in as discussed in Lim et al. We also neglect the \u039b superfluidity effect because the composition of hyperons is highly model dependent and the pairing between \u039b hyperons is not certain. We show that the neutron star EOS with hyperons can be consistent with both mass and temperature observations. We also show that the neutron star EOS with kaons can be consistent with observations, but the cooling behavior is seldom useful to identify or isolate the effect of kaon condensation."

    "article_text_summary": "We demonstrate a novel quartz-enhanced photoacoustic spectroscopy (QEPAS) sensor configuration using two acoustically coupled micro-resonators (MRs) and an off-axis 20 kHz quartz tuning fork (QTF) for the detection of methane. The QEPAS system is pumped resonantly by a nanosecond pulsed single-mode mid-infrared optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The QEPAS sensor is characterized by a high sensitivity and a small spectral resolution bandwidth of 1 cm-1. The QEPAS sensor is capable of detecting methane at a concentration of 0.8 ppm with an integration time of 1 s and a detection limit of 32 ppbv at an integration time of 190 s. The QEPAS sensor system is very useful for environmental, industrial, and biological monitoring, where multiple gaseous pollutants and aerosols need to be monitored simultaneously."

    "article_text_summary": " we introduce a simple tight - binding chain with uniform nearest - neighbor hopping integral as a quantum data bus for long - range quantum transport .   the sender ( alice ) and the receiver ( bob ) can only control the external gate voltages , which are applied on the two end qds .   in this proposal , the quantum information encoded in the polarization of the electron can be transported from alice to bob .   in this scheme the spin state of the electron is a conserved quantity for the hamiltonian of the medium , so the spin state can not be influenced during the propagation .   for simplicity , we will disregard the electron s spin degrees of freedom in the following discussion and just illustrate the principles of qst .   accounting only for the occupation of the lowest single - particle state of each dot , the system is described by an @xmath1-site tight - binding chain .   the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath8where @xmath9 denotes the spinless fermion creation ( annihilation ) operator at the @xmath10-th quantum site .   @xmath4 @xmath11is the coupling constant , which accounts for the hopping of the electron between dots @xmath10 and @xmath12 .   the on - site energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 are modulated in gaussian pulses to realize the adiabatic transfer , according to [ shown in fig .   in this proposal , we will concentrate on the single - particle problem and use the ground state @xmath21 of the hamiltonian @xmath22 to induce a population transfer from state @xmath23 to @xmath24 .   the hamiltonian at @xmath28 reads @xmath29the ground state of eq .   ( [ eq ] ) is a bound state , which can be obtained via the bethe ansatz method .   by choosing a sufficiently large value of @xmath32 , the ground state @xmath33 can be reduced to @xmath34 .   to illustrate with an example , the probability of @xmath35 in @xmath36 can achieve 99.75% when the peak voltage is set to be @xmath37 .   with the same reasoning , in the time limit @xmath38 , the parameter @xmath13 goes to zero and @xmath14 goes to @xmath39 .   due to the reflection symmetry ( relabelling sites from right to left ) of the system , we can see that @xmath40one can see that the ground state of eq .   preparing the system in state @xmath42and adiabatially changing @xmath43 and @xmath14 , one can see that the system will end up in @xmath44 @xmath45    the analysis above is based on the assumption that the adiabaticity is satisfied .   the crucial requirement for adiabatic evolution is @xmath46which greatly suppresses the quantum transition from the ground state @xmath47 to the first - excited state @xmath48 .   firstly , one must make sure that no level crossings occur , i.e.   [ fig2](b ) we present the results showing the eigenenergy gap between the instantaneous first - excited state and ground state undergoing evolution due to modulation of the gate voltage according the pulses given in eq .   the eigenvalues shown in this figure exhibit pronounced avoided crossing and approach nonzero minimum @xmath53 at @xmath54 .   this minimum energy gap plays a significant role in the transfer , because the total evolution time @xmath16 should be large compared to @xmath55 .   in this scheme , the energy gap @xmath56 depends both on the number of qds and gate voltages .   to study the relationship between the total evolution time @xmath16 and system parameters is one of the important contributions of this paper .   it shows the increase of the gap with increasing @xmath69.   [ fig3 ] shows the effect four factors have on the energy gap @xmath70 .   [ fig3](a ) , for a given @xmath52 and @xmath51 , we plot the energy gap @xmath56 as a function of @xmath71 for @xmath7216 , 20 , and 24 .   the numerical results indicate that the gap @xmath73 , which implies that the adiabatic transfer time of qst grows quadratically with the spatial separation of the two end states because the minimum gap plays an opposite role for the adiabatic qst .   the other thing is that @xmath56 is also determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath74 .   [ fig3](b ) we see that the gap becomes larger as @xmath74 increases and then tends to be a constant @xmath76 , which is the gap of tight - binding chain ( @xmath57 ) without any on - site energy .   the reason is that the bigger @xmath77 is , the smaller the overlap amplitude of the two pulses , i.e.   the energy gap @xmath56 of @xmath79 then approaches the maximum value @xmath80 $ ] .   in this section let us firstly review the transfer process of this protocol .   , the total initial state is @xmath82 , and slowly apply gate pulses , which results in robust transport of the electron from one end of the chain to the other .   the consequent time evolution of the state is given by the schrdinger equation ( assuming @xmath83 ) @xmath84    the time evolution creates a coherent superposition : @xmath85where @xmath86 denotes the time - dependent probability amplitude for the electron to be in the @xmath10-th qd that obeys the normalization condition @xmath87 .   at time @xmath88 the fidelity of the initial state transferring to the dot-@xmath1 is defined as @xmath89    a feasible proposal should be able to perform efficient high - fidelity qst in the shortest possible time .   in order to provide the most economical choice of parameters for reaching high transfer efficiency , we used standard numerical methods to integrate the schrdinger equation for probability amplitudes .   because the scheme relies on maintaining adiabatic conditions , we examine the effect of system parameters on the target state population .   [ fig4 ] the probabilities as a function of time for different values of @xmath74 where we take a 5-dot structure for example .   the time behavior of @xmath13 and @xmath14 follow gaussian functions with @xmath37 [ see fig .   2(a ) ] and have been performed in a finite time .   for the @xmath90 case with @xmath91 , which departs from the adiabatic limit , we find the result in fig .   here the population transferred to the target state is only about 11% .   the reason is that the population is excited to the upper energy states through nonadiabaticity .   it is necessary to point out that if one enlarged @xmath16 extremely in this case , adiabaticity would be fulfilled , which would result in high transfer fidelity .   [ fig3 ] , enlarging @xmath74 can increase the level spacing between the first excited state and the ground state and hence cause the adiabaticity of the system to become better .   [ fig4](b ) we show the population evolution taking @xmath52 as an example and the populations of the states @xmath92 and @xmath44 are exchanged with a fidelity of @xmath93 .   the choice of pulse modulation is therefore important with the maximum transfer speed ultimately controlled by the adiabatic criteria for the transfer .   to see the emergence of the adiabatic limit , we plot in fig .   4(c ) the transfer fidelity as a function of the adiabaticity parameter @xmath94 .   one can see that as @xmath95 increases there is an exponential appearance of the adiabaticity in the ideal limit .   that means the smaller the overlapping of two pulses is , the more ideal adiabatic transfer takes place .   in the discussion that follows , we choose @xmath96 .   ( in units of @xmath97 ) as @xmath1 is increased under the condition that @xmath98 .   as @xmath1 is increased the energy gap is decreased , resulting in longer evolution time across the array .   the solid line is the quadratic curve fitting , which indicates that the evolution time grows quadratically with the number of qds .   [ fig5 ] we present results showing @xmath16 as a function of the qds number @xmath1 .   the quadratic curve fitting shows that the minimum possible transfer times are proportional to @xmath101 , giving a high - fidelity transfer of @xmath102 .   on the other hand , the energy gap @xmath56 decreases when the peak value rises [ see fig .   consequently , the time scale @xmath16 is proportional to and of the order of @xmath103 for a given @xmath1 .   to sum up the above discussion , in practice the minimum possible transfer timescale of this adiabatic passage will be of the same order as @xmath104 .   for a long enough evolution time @xmath16 , the maximum fidelity of this scheme depends on the contrast ratio between peak values @xmath105 @xmath106 and coupling constants @xmath99 .   the reason is that small peak values improve adiabaticity , but lead to a low fidelity because the initial and final energy eigenstates are not the desired states @xmath35 and @xmath24 , respectively .   the contour lines , labeled with the corresponding values of @xmath111 , display the gradual increase of transfer fidelity as @xmath112 and @xmath113 grow .   the fidelity is close to one ( @xmath114 ) when two peak values are achieved for @xmath115 @xmath116 .   to determine the parameter range of @xmath105 @xmath106 needed to achieve high fidelity transfer , we numerically integrate the density matrix equations of motion , with varying peak values @xmath117 and @xmath118 from 10 to 25 .   the fidelity approaches unity as @xmath122 and @xmath123 increase .   the figure is nearly symmetric with respect to the line @xmath124 .   we can see that to realize near - perfect fidelity transfer ( @xmath125 ) one has to use peak values satisfying @xmath126 @xmath127 .   we now assume that the tunnel coupling has a random but constant offset @xmath128 , i.e.   @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is drawn from the standard uniform distribution on the open interval @xmath131 and all @xmath130 are completely uncorrelated for all sites along the chain .   it shows that weak fluctuations ( up to @xmath134 ) in the coupling strengths do not deteriorate the performance of our scheme .   to realize high - fidelity qst transfer , the price for unprecise couplings is thus a longer transmission time .   the coupling strengths are chosen randomly from the interval @xmath140 $ ] for @xmath141 ( square ) , @xmath142 ( circle ) and @xmath143 ( triangle ) .   the number of random samples is 20.   we have introduced a robust and coherent method of long - range coherent qst through a tight - binding chain by adiabatic passage .   this scheme is realized by modulation of gate voltages applied on the two end qds .   under suitable gate pulses , the electron can be transported from one end of the chain to the other , carrying along with it the quantum information encoded in its spin .   different from the ctapn scheme @xcite , our method is to induce population transfer through the tight - binding chain by maintaining the system in its ground state and this is more operable in experiments .   we have studied the adiabatic qst through the system by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the ground state evolution of the tight - binding model .   the result shows that it is an efficient high - fidelity process ( @xmath144 ) for a proper choice of standard deviation @xmath145 and peak values @xmath146 of gate voltages .   for an increasing number of dots , we found that the evolution time scale is @xmath147 .   we also consider the qst along the quantum chain if their coupling is changed by some random amount .   we further find that weak fluctuations in the coupling strength still allow high fidelity qst .   we acknowledge the support of the nsf of china ( grant no.10847150 and no.11105086 ) , the shandong provincial natural science foundation ( grant no .   y. x. also thanks the basic scientific research business expenses of the central university and open project of key laboratory for magnetism and magnetic materials of the ministry of education , lanzhou university ( grant no .   graefe e m , korsch h j , witthaut d. mean - field dynamics of a bose - einstein condensate in a time - dependent triple - well trap : nonlinear eigenstates , landau - zener models , and stimulated raman adiabatic passage .

    "article_text_summary": "We propose a stochastic description of slowly sheared granular material that can capture the main characteristics of the flow : the average velocity profiles and force fluctuations in 2 and 3 spatial dimensions. We want to underline the relatively good agreement with experimental data with regards to the small number of ingredients introduced. In particular, we ignored the existence of granular density variations along the direction normal to the flow which may induce significant corrections. The crucial assumption of this model lies in the self - similar structure of moving clusters that rapidly form and disappear as the material flows. This assumption has been qualitatively suggested by the mere observation of 3-d couette flows watched from below through a transparent bottom plate where the jerky and multi - scale dynamics is clearly visible. We hope that this tentative description will motivate further quantitative investigations to probe the nature of space and time correlations in the motion of neighboring particles in such systems. Here we have focused on recent experimental data in order to test this self - similar model but we think that this simple description of dense granular dynamics as a super - imposition of coherent moves can be extended to many more geometries and processes than just plane shear. The issue is to correctly prescribe the coherence length mapping @xmath61 , and describe the probability @xmath6 for each realization . In particular , we anticipate that the existence of multiple relaxation times recently demonstrated in granular compaction experiments could be associated with rearrangements over different length - scales during the relaxation of the packing structure . To that extent , this model may offer a clue to understand the numerous features that granular material share with glassy liquids below the glass transition ( aging , slow relaxation , jamming ) ."

    "article_text_summary": "In this project we have investigated the microscopic behaviour of a collective decision making process and related it to a macroscopic description. We have extended the approach of Biancalani et al. and Hamann et al. and experimentally determined the plot of the average change of the swarm fraction and the probabilities of firing the majority and minority rules. We have shown that the drift trajectory is nothing but the weighted sum of these probability distributions which can be successfully modelled by hyper-geometric distribution and thus a purely analytic form of the average change of the swarm fraction can be given."

    "abstract_text": " we report on a first - principles study of the structure of o / rh(001 ) at half a monolayer of oxygen coverage , performed using density - functional theory .   we find that oxygen atoms sit at the center of the _ black _ squares of a chess - board , @xmath0 , pattern .   this structure is unstable against a rhomboid distortion of the _ black _ squares , which shortens the distance between an o atom and two of the four neighboring rh atoms , while lengthening the distance with respect to the other two .   we actually find that the surface energy is further lowered by allowing the o atom to get off the short diagonal of the rhombus so formed .   we predict that the latter distortion is associated with an order - disorder transition , occurring below room temperature .   the above rhomboid distortion of the square lattice may be seen as a rotation of the empty , _ white _ , squares .   our findings are at variance with recent claims based on stm images , according to which it is instead the _ black _ squares which would rotate .   we argue that these images are indeed compatible with our predicted reconstruction pattern .      _ keywords : _ chemisorption ; rhodium ; oxygen ; density functional calculations  ",
    "article_text_summary": "We present an _ ab - initio _ study of the oxygen adsorption on the rh(001 ) surface . In agreement with experimental findings , we find that the preferred adsorption site is the _ hollow _ one , at the center of the square formed by four first - layer rhodium atoms . However , at variance with recent claims based on stm experiments @xcite , we find that it is the _ white _ squares which rotate rather than the _ black _ ones ( see fig . Actually , the symmetry of our predicted reconstruction pattern slightly differs from what appears in the experimental stm pictures , in that ad - atoms get off the center of the distorted squares , thus resulting in an _ asymmetric clock _ reconstruction . The existence of two inequivalent low - symmetry sites that oxygen atoms can occupy in the rhombi should give rise to an order - disorder transition whose properties , however , lie beyond the scope of the present study . The amplitude of the asymmetric component of the reconstruction might be too small to be detected experimentally . Furthermore , it is likely that the temperatures at which these stm images have been taken lie above the critical temperature of transition . In order to understand the driving mechanism of the reconstruction , this is better visualized as a rhomboid deformation of the squares filled by adsorbed oxygen atoms . This distortion can then be rationalized by a simple chemical model of the re - bonding of o atoms at the surface . Our calculations are based on density functional theory within the local - density approximation @xcite , using ceperley - alder exchange - correlation ( xc ) energies @xcite . The one - particle kohn - sham equations are solved self - consistently using plane - wave basis sets in a pseudopotential scheme . Because of the well known _ hardness _ of the norm - conserving pseudopotentials for the o and  to a lesser extent  rh atoms , we make use of _ ultra - soft _ pseudopotentials @xcite which allow an accurate description of the o and rh valence pseudo - wave - functions with a modest basis set including plane waves up to a kinetic - energy cutoff of 30 ry . In the case of rh , we found it convenient to treat the @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels using a norm - conserving potential , while the ultra - soft scheme is applied only to the _ hard _ @xmath5 orbital @xcite . We find that the structural properties of bulk rhodium are well converged using a first - order gaussian smearing function @xcite of width @xmath6 and @xmath7 special * k*-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone ( ibz ) . We have used the same super - cell for both the clean and the o - covered surfaces . For the clean surface we have used @xmath8 atomic layers plus a vacuum region corresponding to @xmath9 layers . For the o - covered surface , the @xmath8 rh layers are completed by one layer of o molecules on each side of the slab : in this case the vacuum region is correspondingly reduced to @xmath10 atomic layers . We have used the same gaussian - smearing function as in the bulk calculations with a @xmath11 monkhorst - pack mesh @xcite resulting in @xmath12 special * k*-points in the @xmath13 surface ibz . Convergence tests performed with a value of @xmath14 twice as small and a correspondingly finer mesh of special points resulted in no significant changes in total energies and equilibrium geometries . The latter are found by allowing all the atoms in the slab to relax until the force acting on each of them is smaller than @xmath15 . For the clean surface we find that  in agreement with other _ ab - initio _ calculations @xcite  the first layer relaxes inward by @xmath16 ( see table [ tabella ] ) , while the second layer is practically unrelaxed ( the error is essentially a finite - size effect , and it is estimated by repeating the calculation using thicker slabs ) . As it was noted in the introduction , the value of the first - layer relaxation reported in the experimental literature is anomalously small ( the first interlayer spacing is practically equal to its bulk value within error bars ) . Recently , cho and scheffler @xcite pointed out that a proper account of the vibrational contribution to the surface free energy may results in a reduction of the inward relaxation of the first layer , thus bringing theoretical predictions in better agreement with experiments . Our calculated values for the surface energy , @xmath14 , and work function , @xmath17 , are @xmath18 and @xmath19 ( see table [ tabella ] ) . A special care must be payed when estimating the latter , for the xc potential goes to zero rather slowly in the vacuum region . As the electrostatic ( hartree ) potential converges much more rapidly than the xc one to its vacuum value , it is convenient to evaluate the vacuum level by simply neglecting the xc contributions . As a preliminary study of oxygen adsorption , we performed a couple of simple _ ab - initio _ molecular dynamics simulations of an @xmath20 molecule impinging onto the surface . We have tried two possible initial conditions for the molecule , in both of which the axis of the molecule is parallel to the surface . In the first case the projection of the center of the molecule on the surface falls on top of a surface atom , while in the other it falls on a bridge site . The initial velocity of the molecule is orthogonal to the surface and its modulus corresponds to a temperature of @xmath21k , while the surface is initially assumed to be at zero temperature . The initial distance of the molecule from the surface is @xmath22 a.u . When the molecule arrives at the surface the molecular bond breaks and the surface heats up . In order to find the ground - state atomic configuration , we have slowly cooled down the system , ending in the structure displayed in fig . [ nuovastruttura ] : the oxygen atoms adsorb in every second hollow site of the surface , resulting in a c@xmath23 structure , where the squares whose centers are occupied by an ad - atom are deformed into rhombi ; the oxygens do not stay in the middle of the short diagonal of the rhombus so formed , but move away in the orthogonal direction , becoming essentially _ three - fold _ coordinated . As a result of the reduced symmetry so obtained , the atomic rows of the first rh layer are no longer equivalent to each other : every second row is formed by atoms which have 2 oxygen neighbors , while the others have only 1 neighbor . As a consequence the first rhodium layer results to be buckled , the 2-fold coordinated rows leaning @xmath24 outwards . This _ asymmetric clock _ reconstruction can be imagined as the succession of two steps : in the first , the occupied , _ black _ , squares distort while the ad - atoms stay at the center of the rhombi ( _ symmetric clock _ reconstruction ) ; in the second , the ad - atom depart from the centers of the rhombi , in order to achieve three - fold coordination . Both the unreconstructed and _ symmetric clock _ structures result to be saddle points whose energies are reported in table [ tabella ] . We have explicitly verified that the unreconstructed structure is stable against analogous distortions affecting the _ white _ squares . For the sake of completeness , in table [ tabella ] we also report the relative surface energies corresponding to two other adsorption sites ( see fig . [ siti ] ) , which are however much larger than the energy differences between the unreconstructed _ hollow _ structure and the corresponding _ clock _ reconstructions . The work function is larger at coverage @xmath25 than for the clean surface ( see table [ tabella ] ) , thus indicating that electrons tend to transfer from the rh substrate to the oxygen layer , so as to increase the surface dipole . [ coverage ] we display the adsorption energy , @xmath26 , as a function of coverage , @xmath27 , defined as : @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the surface energy of the oxygen - covered system , and @xmath30 is the energy of the isolated @xmath20 molecule . The minimum energy corresponds to a coverage in the range @xmath35 . In this range , however , the curve is very flat and the variation of the adsorption energy ( @xmath36 ) is smaller than the expected accuracy of the terms which enter its definition . The value of the most stable coverage is determined by a trade - off between the adsorption energy of an isolated oxygen molecule , which tends to favor a high coverage , and the oxygen - oxygen electrostatic repulsion due to charge transfer , which becomes more effective when the average @xmath39 distance becomes smaller than some typical screening length , and which tends instead to favor a low coverage . [ nuovastruttura ] it is evident that the oxygen sub - lattice forms a _ zig - zag _ arrangement which is not observed in the experiments @xcite . However , there are two equivalent threefold sites for each cell occupied by an oxygen ad - atom , one on each side of the bridge . We postulate that the system undergoes an order - disorder transition at some critical temperature which depends on the magnitude of the adsorbate - adsorbate interactions , and that this temperature is lower than that at which the stm images have been taken . The fact that no disorder in the o ad - layer appears from these images indicates that the frequency of oxygen barrier crossing is much larger than the scanning frequency of the stm . This is compatible with our estimate of the barrier height ( @xmath40 mev , as obtained by comparing the energies of the _ symmetric clock _ and the _ asymmetric clock _ structures ) which is of the order of the room temperature . @xcite are such that only rh or o atoms are visible in turn in a same picture . Because of this , it is difficult to judge whether the squares that undergo a rhomboid distortion are those filled by an ad - atom , or they are instead empty . What appears to be rather evident is that the distorted squares display a depletion with respect to the undistorted ones . In analogy with a similar reconstruction which is observed to occur in n / ni(001 ) and which is much better characterized @xcite , the authors of ref . @xcite conclude that o atoms are thrust down the first rh layer in the middle of the undistorted squares . We have simulated stm pictures using the tersoff - hamann model @xcite , but we have not been able to eliminate the images of the o atoms from any of our simulated pictures . In all of them , o atoms appear as protrusions in the middle of the distorted squares , in qualitative agreement with the experimental observation that undistorted squares are depleted with respect to the distorted ones . [ proj ] we display the surface - projected densities of states ( sdos ) of the clean and of the oxygen - covered rh(001 ) surface , along with their decompositions into various atomic - like contributions . The sdos of the clean surface differs from its bulk counterpart mainly because of its more pronounced narrowness due to the lower coordination of surface atoms @xcite , and it is almost entirely determined by its @xmath5-like component ( see fig . This degeneracy is partially lifted at the surface because the surface atoms lose the neighbors in the direction orthogonal to the surface . For the ( 001 ) surface , the @xmath45 and @xmath42 orbitals are still equivalent by symmetry and , hence , degenerate . The position of the oxygen atomic @xmath4-level is around 3.1 ev below the fermi energy of the oxygen - covered surface . Upon oxygen adsorption , first - layer rh atoms become locally inequivalent according to whether the neighboring oxygen atoms are aligned along the @xmath50 or @xmath51 directions ( see fig . It is also easy to recognize that the same bonding and anti - bonding features occur in the @xmath42 band whose atomic orbitals have lobes oriented towards the adsorbed oxygen , while the @xmath45 band remains similar to that of the clean surface ( see fig . [ proj]c ) because in that direction the surface sites are empty . We find that the c(@xmath2 ) structure is not the most stable one and that a ( @xmath2)p4 g reconstruction occurs which shortens and strengthens the bonds o@xmath52rh along one direction , while lengthening them in the perpendicular direction , as illustrated in fig [ proj]e . The amplitude of the distortion depends rather sensitively on the lattice parameter : using our calculated lattice parameter , we estimate the distortion to be @xmath53 ; if one uses a lattice parameter @xmath54 larger , the amplitude of the distortion also is increased , reaching a value @xmath55 . The tendency of the system to strengthen two of the four rhodium bonds at the expenses of the other two results in a net lowering of the surface energy of @xmath56 mev / atom , thus stabilizing the ( @xmath2)p4 g structure . In the _ asymmetric clock _ more stable structure the amount of the distortion is @xmath57 ( using our calculated lattice parameter ) and the surface energy gain is @xmath58 30 mev / atom . This shows that the reconstruction occurs because the optimal o@xmath52rh bond - length is shorter than that realized in the ideal geometry . The _ chemical _ contribution to the energy lowering which determines the distortion is illustrated in fig . In both cases , we notice a push of states towards lower energies . Our _ ab - initio _ results confirm the experimental evidence of the dissociative character of the oxygen adsorption on rh ( 001 ) and that the favored adsorption site is the _ fourfold _ one . A ( @xmath61)p4 g reconstruction of the surface is also predicted , in agreement with spa - leed data . At variance with claims based on recent stm work , we find that this reconstruction is due to a rhomboid distortion of the squares formed by first - layer rh atoms which have an o atom adsorbed in the middle , and that this structure is unstable with respect to a departure of the ad - atoms from the centers of the resulting rhombi . We argue that the experimental evidence upon which these claims are founded is rather weak and we suggest therefore that further experimental work is needed to fully characterize the reconstruction of this surface . Furthermore , we find evidence that an order - disorder transition should occur at some temperature below that at which the stm pictures have been taken . Our findings are substantiated by a simple chemical model of the mechanisms responsible for the reconstruction . Our calculations were performed on the sissa ibm - sp2 and cineca - infm cray - t3d / e parallel machines in trieste and bologna respectively , using the parallel version of the pwscf code . Access to the cray machines has been granted within the _ iniziativa trasversale calcolo parallelo _ of the infm . @xmath62 is the bulk lattice spacing , @xmath63 is the distance between the oxygen atoms and the first rhodium layer , @xmath64 the distance between the first and the second layer . For the asymmetric clock reconstruction the two given numbers refer to the two inequivalent first layer rhodium atoms ( see fig . @xmath65 is the amplitude of the movement of the first - layer rhodium atoms upon distortion ( see fig ."

    "article_text_summary": " we are concerned with the problem of speaker detection , where an automatic speaker recognizer is used to decide whether or not the voice of a designated target speaker is present in a given speech segment . current speaker recognition algorithms output uncalibrated _ scores _ , which have to be processed through a calibration stage before cost effective decisions can be made . this paper deals with the problem of designing the calibration stage . we implement the calibration stage in the form of a discriminative model , say @xmath0 , which outputs a posterior probability that the target speaker spoke the speech segment : @xmath1 . the trial score , @xmath2 , is computed by the speaker recognizer as a function of the target speaker and the speech segment . this posterior can be used in a straight - forward , standard way to make minimum - expected - cost bayes decisions . we shall take as the baseline discriminative model prior - weighted logistic regression  @xcite , which has become a standard recipe for calibration in speaker recognition , with implementations available in the focal  @xcite and bosaris  @xcite toolkits . logistic regression is the minimization of the expected value of a special cost function , known as the _ logarithmic proper scoring rule_. we are interested here in generalizing this recipe by modifying the cost function . our motivation derives from  @xcite , where it was demonstrated that a modified logistic regression that ignores scores below a suitable threshold can benefit applications with low false - alarm rate requirements . in this work we limit ourselves to cost functions which are _ proper scoring rules _  @xcite . we expand on our previous work  @xcite , to demonstrate theoretically and experimentally that we can tailor proper scoring rules to target the low false - alarm region . given a database of supervised trials , the sum over trials of a proper scoring rule forms an objective function that can be used to simply evaluate the goodness of a recognizer with probabilistic output , and indeed also to facilitate discriminative training of such recognizers . we restrict ourselves to _ binary _ proper scoring rules , a family of special cost functions of the form @xmath3 , which evaluates the goodness of the recognizer output @xmath4 , for a trial where hypothesis @xmath5 is true . we use the notation @xmath6 for a trial where the target speaker spoke and @xmath7 for one where some other speaker spoke . in what follows it will be convenient to work with recognizer outputs in the form of posterior probabilities : @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is the uncalibrated trial score and @xmath0 is the calibration model . later we show how to adapt this to recognizer outputs in likelihood - ratio form . a binary proper scoring can be seen as a _ model of an application _ of a detector  or more generally , a mixture of such applications . an application , @xmath9 , is represented by a cost function @xmath10 , which maps outcomes to real - valued consequences . the sets from which decisions are chosen may differ between applications , for example @xmath13 , or @xmath14 , and so on . our application model assumes that the detector output , @xmath4 , is used to make a minimum - expected - cost bayes decision : @xmath15 the associated _ proper scoring rule _ is defined as the cost of this decision  @xcite : @xmath16 a convex combination of proper scoring rules is still a proper scoring rule , in the sense that it can be derived via   from a suitably constructed cost function that represents a mixture of different applications  @xcite . although applications may be defined via a large variety of cost functions , all of this variety can be conveniently represented in a surprisingly simple form  @xcite . all binary proper scoring rules can be expressed in the form : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . the constants @xmath21 do nt play any useful role in the bayes decision framework and may be set to @xmath22 and @xmath23 without loss of generality  @xcite . the weighting distribution @xmath24 can be very general , including smooth functions , step functions or even impulses . the impulse @xmath25 represents a single , _ simple application _ , with binary decisions in @xmath13 , a cost function with penalties @xmath26 and @xmath27 and the bayes decision threshold at @xmath28 . a sum of impulses represents a discrete mixture of applications , while a smooth function represents a continuous mixture over a continuous spectrum of applications . the important point here is that all bayes decision applications ( or mixtures of applications ) can be represented by   via a suitable choice of @xmath24 . here we build an objective function , for training or evaluation , out of a proper scoring rule , @xmath29 . the proper scoring rule models the cost of making a bayes decision in a single detection trial . to turn this into an objective function , we take the _ expected _ cost over a whole supervised database . we form this expectation via two hypothesis conditional averages , weighted by a synthetic class prior ( usually different from the database proportions ) , of the form @xmath30 , @xmath31 . the expected cost is : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the recognizer s posterior for trial @xmath34 ; @xmath35 is a set of @xmath36 target trial indices ; and @xmath37 a set of @xmath38 non - target indices . now , we relieve the calibrator of the ( implicit ) responsibility to have a hypothesis prior and to produce posteriors . instead , we require it to output _ log - likelihood - ratios _ , denoted @xmath39 . since the prior is already fixed as a parameter of the objective  , the recognizer s posterior is given by bayes rule as : as the ratio of two generative likelihoods adds no value . instead should be taken as the definition of @xmath39 . ] @xmath40 where @xmath41 is prior log odds and @xmath42 is the logistic sigmoid : @xmath43 after some manipulation , we can express the functions of @xmath33 in   as functions of @xmath39 instead : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a translated and modulated version of @xmath24 , where the modulation factor : @xmath46 is a raised and scaled sigmoid . the integrals in   can be interpreted as averaging over all possible cost functions , where @xmath24 determines the relative importance of different cost functions . in our construction of the objective function , we inherit this averaging over cost functions , but we seem to have fixed the prior at @xmath49 . since different applications of a speaker detector can be expected to have different priors , should we not also average over @xmath49 ? we can , but it adds no generality , because this would effectively just replace @xmath47 in   by some other normalized / normalizable weighting distribution , say @xmath50 . we can now reformulate our objective function in its most general form as : @xmath51 where @xmath52 we now have a general objective function , parametrized by @xmath50 , which effectively determines the relative weighting over a mixture of different applications , each of which can have a different cost function and target prior . thus , the combination of application costs in   is accomplished via representing applications by their thresholds . here we introduce a practical choice for the weighting distribution , @xmath50 and show how it is used for calibration . since calibration involves optimization , smooth differentiable distributions are easier to work with . it is also desirable that the integrals have closed - form solutions . to this end , we adopt a 2-parameter ( here @xmath56 ) family of proper scoring rules proposed in  @xcite . this family is effectively augmented by a third parameter , @xmath57 , via the prior - weighting in  . this gives @xmath58 : @xmath59 where @xmath60 ; @xmath61 is defined in  ; @xmath62 ensures the distribution is normalized ; and @xmath63 is the beta distribution , transformed to log - odds domain : @xmath64 and @xmath65 is the beta function . while this recipe is practically realized via   and  , a theoretical interpretation is given by   and  , because for this parametrization we have @xmath70 . we exploit this in figure  [ fig : omega ] , where we plot   for several values of the parameters . parameters @xmath56 control left and right tails respectively  when they are increased tails become thinner and the distributions become narrower ( higher modes ) . location is indirectly controlled by @xmath41 , but this depends on @xmath56 . for @xmath72 , the mode shifts only as far as @xmath73 , while the distribution is considerably widened . however , when @xmath74 , the mode shifts close to @xmath75 and the widening is less dramatic . we show in our experiments below that when we target applications with high thresholds ( low false - alarm rate ) , then the effective shifting allowed by @xmath74 leads to better performance than the halfway shifted and stretched version given by the baseline logistic regression solution with @xmath72 . here we list some solutions for the integrals in  , which we used in our experiments . the _ boosting rule _ @xcite , with @xmath71 : @xmath76 the _ logarithmic rule _ , with @xmath72 , forms the objective function for logistic regression and is our baseline : @xmath77 the parametrization @xmath78 gives ( up to scaling ) , the objective @xmath79 , proposed in  @xcite for the evaluation of goodness of recognizers with likelihood - ratio output . the _ brier rule _ @xcite , with @xmath80 : @xmath81 an _ asymmetric _ rule , with @xmath82 : @xmath83      we assume that our recognizers output uncalibrated scores . let the score for a trial @xmath34 be denoted @xmath84 . we then apply a parametric ( affine ) calibration transformation : @xmath85 the calibration parameters @xmath86 need to be trained on a calibration training database . for training purposes , we choose and fix the parameters @xmath87 and then minimize the objective   w.r.t . in the special case @xmath72 such training is known as logistic regression . since the objective and the calibration transformation are differentiable , one can obtain the gradient w.r.t . @xmath86 by backpropagation and then use any of a variety of well - known unconstrained numerical optimization algorithms . we performed calibration experiments on scores from a single speaker recognizer ( an i - vector plda system ) , which was part of the abc submission  @xcite to the nist sre12 speaker recognition evaluation . several calibration transformations of the form   were trained ( separately for males and females ) on a large development set with multiple microphone and telephone speech segments of 2019 speakers from sre04 , 05 , 06 , 08 and 10 . we tested the goodness of these calibrators on the nist sre12 extended trial set  @xcite , where we pooled males and females and all 5 common evaluation conditions , giving about 80 million trials . our evaluation criterion was @xmath88 , with @xmath89 , as defined in  @xcite . it should be noted that this criterion can _ also _ be interpreted as an example of our objective function  , since @xmath90 , if we choose @xmath91 , defined as : @xmath92 which is concentrated in two impulses ] at the log - likelihood - ratio threshold values of @xmath93 and @xmath94 . this criterion was chosen by nist to be calibration - sensitive , but only in the ` low false - alarm region ' around these operating points . our experimental results are summarized in figure  [ fig : results ] , where we plotted @xmath88 obtained by using the calibrators formed by three representative proper scoring rules against the prior - weighting parameter , @xmath57 . our baseline ( blue triangles ) is logistic regression ( @xmath72 ) . the other two rules with @xmath74 ( red circles , green asterisks ) , gave better performance in the sense of having lower , wider minima . the boosting rule ( @xmath71 ) performed very poorly , at @xmath95 , and is not shown on the graph . the reason why different proper scoring rules perform differently is that the affine calibration transformation is limiting . it can not satisfy the requirement of good calibration at all operating points simultaneously . we have to choose , via @xmath50 , which operating points are important and which can be ignored . this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : pav ] , where we compare the log - likelihood - ratios produced for sre12 by two of the proper scoring rule calibrations ( horizontal axis ) , against ideal , reference log - likelihood - ratios ( vertical axis ) . ideally these plots should lie along the identity transform ( the black diagonal through the origin ) . but the affine calibration transformation can only try to fit these curves to the ideal straight line via scaling and shifting the curves along the horizontal axis . the logistic regression ( @xmath72 ) places more weight at lower threshold values and indeed manages to be closer to the ideal there , to the detriment of calibration at the higher @xmath96 operating points . on the other hand , the brier rule ( @xmath80 ) , which places more weight at the @xmath96 operating points , does better there , but pays for this by doing worse at lower threshold values . the ideal reference along the vertical axis of figure  [ fig : pav ] is achieved via an optimization algorithm known as _ pool adjacent violators _ ( pav)@xcite . this algorithm finds the optimal log - likelihood - ratio value for every trial non - parametrically , subject only to the constraint that when sorted along the real line , the order of the optimized values must be the same as the sorted order of the original uncalibrated scores . the pav output is optimal in the sense that it simultaneously optimizes all binary proper scoring rules at all values of the prior weighting  @xcite . the pav solution can be optimal everywhere because the non - parametric monotonicity constraint is less strict than the parametric affine transformation available to the proper scoring rule calibrators . it is important to note however that the true sre12 class labels were used to perform the pav optimization , while the proper scoring rule calibrations were optimized on the independent development data . if the pav had been optimized on the development data , it would no longer have this optimality on the evaluation data . very similar to the best proper scoring rule results shown in figure  [ fig : results ] . the details are out of scope for this paper . ] the superiority demonstrated here of rules with @xmath97 may not hold for : ( i ) small calibration training databases ; ( ii ) other recognizers ; ( iii ) applications with thresholds in other operating regions . the objective function family presented here could be more generally applied , not just for calibration . these objectives could be used for fusion of multiple recognizers , or indeed for more general discriminative training of speaker recognizers in the manner of  @xcite . however for more complex recognizers , the risk of overtraining is greater  and this risk may be compounded by more narrowly focussed objectives , such as the brier rule . in contrast , the wider focus of the logarithmic rule has a regularizing effect , which combats overtraining . `` fusion of heterogeneous speaker recognition systems in the stbu submission for the nist speaker recognition evaluation 2006 '' , ieee transactions on audio , speech , and language processing , september 2007 . niko brmmer and johan du preez , `` application -

    "article_text_summary": "We analyze the issue of entanglement production in a dynamical gravitational collapse. We consider both a bosonic (scalar) and a fermionic (grassmann scalar) field which initially are in the vacuum state and compute their asymptotic time evolution under the gravitational interaction in a stellar collapse. The vacuum state evolves to an entangled state of modes in the future null infinity (which give rise to Hawking radiation) and modes that do not reach it because they fall into the forming event horizon. We argue that the initial vacuum state in the asymptotic past does not have any physical quantum entanglement, and that it evolves to a state that is physically entangled as a consequence of the creation of the event horizon. This entanglement depends on the mass of the black hole and the frequency of the field modes. The entanglement generated in a gravitational collapse thus appears as a quantum resource for non-demolition methods aiming to extract information about the field modes which fall into the horizon from the outgoing Hawking radiation. These methods would be most relevant for cases such as the formation of micro-black holes and the final stages of an evaporating black hole when the mass is getting smaller and, therefore, quantum correlations generated between the Hawking radiation and the infalling modes grow to become even maximal, as we will show. Earlier works proved that fermions and bosons have qualitatively different behaviors in phenomena such as the Unruh entanglement degradation and the entanglement generation in the background of expanding universes. Here, we will show that for fermions the generation of entanglement due to gravitational collapse is more robust than for bosons. This robustness is more evident from the peak of the thermal spectrum of Hawking radiation towards the ultraviolet. Previous works in the literature showed that Hawking radiation is correlated with the field state falling into the collapsing star. However neither the analysis of the associated entanglement entropy as a function of the black hole parameters nor the comparison between fermionic and bosonic behavior have been carried out so far. The study of these issues, the nature of the entanglement produced in a gravitational collapse and, more important, its dependence on the nature of the quantum field (bosonic/fermionic) is decisive in order to gain a deeper understanding about quantum entanglement in general relativistic scenarios as it was proven for other setups such as acceleration horizons, eternal black holes and expanding universes. Since entanglement is a pure quantum effect, understanding its behavior in these scenarios can well be relevant to discern the genuine quantum Hawking radiation from classical induced emission in black hole analogs, where both classical and quantum perturbations obey the same evolution laws. It will also follow from our study that fermionic modes could be more suitable for this task since they are more reliable in encoding entanglement information. Finally, we will argue that the entanglement between the infalling and the Hawking radiation modes neither existed as a quantum information resource nor could have been acknowledged by any observer before the collapse occurs, namely in the asymptotic past. This is important in order to understand the dynamics of the creation of correlations in the gravitational collapse scenario since these correlations are exclusively due to quantum entanglement, as discussed in the literature. In order to analyze the entanglement production induced by gravitational collapse we will consider the Vaidya dynamical solution to Einstein equations that, despite its simplicity, contains all the ingredients relevant to our study. Refinements of the model to make it more realistic only introduce subleading corrections."

    "article_text_summary": "The high energy stereoscopic system (HESS) is an array of four imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes working in stereoscopic mode. Each of the present \"small\" Cherenkov telescopes (SCT) has a 12-meter diameter mirror and is equipped with a 960-pixel (photomultiplier) camera at its focal plane. In addition to photon showers, the combinatorial background from diffuse sky photons and charged cosmic showers can trigger the telescopes. Stereoscopy allows one to achieve a large rejection of the single muon triggers. These single muons come from very distant hadronic showers and dominate the single-telescope particle triggers. The single muon trigger rate is discussed in section [sect:part_trig_rates]. Collaboration has started to build a fifth, 28-meter-diameter large Cherenkov telescope (LCT). The LCT will be sensitive to photons down to 10 GeV. In normal operation, the SCTs are triggered only in case of a coincidence with another telescope (LCT or SCT). However, the energy threshold of SCTs is too high to efficiently detect low energy (1 GeV) rays. To increase its acceptance at low photon energies, the HESS instrument will have to accept standalone LCT triggers. Assuming similar first level trigger conditions on the SCTs and the LCT, these standalone LCT triggers would have a rate which is typically a factor of five larger than H.E.S.S stereoscopic triggers. As shown later in section [sect:part_trig_rates], these triggers are mostly background triggers. Collaboration has decided to build a second level (L2) trigger board in the camera of the LCT to improve the rejection of accidental night-sky background triggers and single muon triggers. For instance, low energy selection algorithms similar to the trigger used by the MAGIC collaboration to detect the pulsed emission from the Crab pulsar can be implemented. Alternatively, at constant energy threshold, the gain in bandwidth obtained by rejecting the background events can be used to transfer timing informations on fired pixels to the acquisition farm, in addition to the total charge. The timing information may be useful for analyzing single telescope events, as has also been shown by the MAGIC collaboration. For example, the MAGIC collaboration uses a n-next-neighbor logic in its first level trigger and has designed a second-level trigger which can perform a rough event analysis and can apply topological cuts to the images. In the first part of this paper, the various contributions to the LCT instrument trigger rate are listed and evaluated. The next section is devoted to the L2 concept and an example L2 trigger algorithm is given. The actual L2 trigger board is described in section [sect:hardware]. Finally, the on-board implementation of the L2 algorithm is discussed in section [sect:firmware]. The largest contributions to the trigger rate of single telescopes in gamma-ray astronomy are background events. An important source of background events comes from the coincidental quasi-simultaneous firing of pixels by diffuse photons, the so-called night sky background (NSB). The NSB originates in diffuse sources, such as the zodiacal light or unresolved light from the galactic plane, and light from bright stars. Site and NSB photoelectron rates were derived for the SCT. The expected NSB photoelectron rate is 2 MHz per pixel at zenith in extragalactic fields. In galactic fields, the single pixel rate is higher and reaches 200-300 MHz per pixel. The LCT has a larger collection area (596 m2 compared to 108 m2), but more pixels (2048 instead of 960) and a smaller angular acceptance (3. The expected NSB rate per pixel of the LCT is thus expected to be larger by a factor 1.3. These showers are induced by interactions of cosmic hadrons (proton, helium) or electrons/positrons in the atmosphere. Isolated muons from distant hadron showers also trigger single Cherenkov telescopes. The NSB L1 trigger rate was simulated by adding random photoelectrons to every readout channel. Trigger rates caused by NSB single pixel photo-electron rates of 100, 200 and 300 MHz have been calculated. The corresponding LCT L1 trigger rates are given in table [tab:nsb] for several L1 trigger conditions. Depending on conditions, the estimated rates range from several MHz to less than a few tens of Hz. Since the dead time per event of the LCT acquisition is of the order of a few microseconds, the acquisition rate should be no more than 100 kHz. Table [tab:nsb] shows that some L1 trigger conditions (e.g. A purely sequential software implementation of the clustering and denoising operators in steps 1 and 3 is clearly time-consuming and sub-optimal. We thus turned to a parallel hardware implementation: considering the binary nature of the , the non-linear filters involved are easily built using logic and and or gates. For instance, denoising is achieved by convolving with a simple filter such that: where is used to index the 6 nearest neighbors of pixel . A wider filter with a support extending to second neighbors is used to detect clusters of at least three pixels as shown in figure . In order to process 32 pixels from 4 adjacent FE boards in parallel, one needs the values of 58 first and second neighbor pixels from 12 neighboring FE boards as shown in figure . On the edges of the camera, one or more bytes are set to zero. We note here that filtering is a local operation. For this reason, the L2 data pipeline reorganizes the input binary data matrix to provide local access to and . This way, each 32-bit word read by the PPC gives the binary values of 32 pixels from one of the 64 groups of 4 adjacent FE boards of the LCT camera and each byte maps to one FE board, as shown in figure . In practice, there are different possibilities for connecting the proposed logic filter to the PPC. The best timing results were obtained using the APU : experimentally, denoising and 3 pixel cluster detection take PPC clock cycles with using a custom peripheral on the PLB while it takes only cycles using the APU. Computing the first and second order moments of the denoised combined map is a common preliminary for the estimation of Hillas statistics and other parameters of interest . Let us define: where indexes the 2048 pixels in the processed data maps, and is the weight assigned to pixel . Fortunately, a faster computation is possible thanks to the structure of the binary data matrix described in the previous section and to the linearity of the above quantities with respect to the pixel weights. Hence the binary maps and can be processed separately and the sums are profitably rearranged for an efficient hierarchical computation of the moments. First a byte-addressable look-up table (LUT) is used to compute the desired statistics on each FE board in a local coordinate frame attached to the 8 pixels on a single FE board as shown in figure . The LUT outputs are then combined locally to compute these statistics for the four FE boards in each of the 64 pairs of drawers. This local summation requires the LUT outputs to be properly translated depending on the position of a given FE board in the current pair of drawers. As shown in figure , a different coordinate frame is used when handling the 32 pixels in a pair of drawers. Finally, summation over the 64 pairs of drawers requires an additional transformation of these partial statistics to account for the translation and scaling of the local frame required to move a pair of drawer to its correct position within the global coordinate frame of the camera. With this fast implementation, the PPC computes the first and second order moments of the input data in a maximum of 18000 clock cycles. For a faster execution time, given that these statistics will most often be estimated for low energy events when only very few pixels are high in and even less in , it is worth checking if a byte is zero prior to computing its contribution to the statistics. As a result the computation time will vary almost linearly with the number of active bytes in the data. The algorithm proposed in section uses only the first-order statistics to compute the nominal distance obviously in finite precision: where the factor is due to the equilateral triangular grid and the accompanying left out in the moment computation for simplicity. The specified precision on the target coordinates is of the unit length, motivating the precision to which the center of gravity ( ) coordinates have to be computed. Finally, thresholding the squared nominal distance avoids the costly computation of a square root. The accelerated blocks described above (leaving out second order moments) were readily integrated into a fully functional L2 trigger system running on the specifically designed hardware. In practice, two simple architectures were tested for preliminary timing experiments in order to benchmark the performance of the L2 trigger system. The second design uses the five Virtex4-FX FPGAs available on one L2 trigger board. In this case, the Virtex4 on the EB receives the data from the FE, forwards it to the MMs and reads back their decisions. Events are assigned to MMs in a simple round robin procedure. Each MM is in charge of executing the complete decision algorithm. In this simple design, there is no pipelining of events in the MMs. For these experiments, an additional evaluation board is used to emulate the L2 trigger s environment. This testbench is capable of generating L1 trigger events periodically at a specified rate, as well as bursts of specified lengths. Consider first the unrealistic worst case scenario where all events are monoscopic with all pixels high above the higher threshold resulting in the longest processing time. With this setup a stable behavior of the first single FPGA system was observed up to a maximum L1 rate slightly above 10 kHz. The second multi-FPGA system could sustain a maximum mean rate close to 30 kHz. In fact, the additional communication tasks between the EB and MMs in the multi-FPGA system are in part responsible for the less than four-fold gain. Adding more MMs to the system will only increase the maximum acceptable L1 rate to the point where the slowest concurrent process in the pipeline can handle it, which is  khz in the current multi-FPGA design. The above estimates are clearly highly pessimistic as they are based on unrealistic data. A more realistic estimation of the PPC occupancy is plotted in figure for the first implementation of the L2 trigger system. This estimate is based on the simulated statistical distribution of input events reported in section and on time measurements of the different elementary steps in the L2 trigger pipeline. For typical L1 trigger conditions - multiplicity set to 3 or 4 and pixel threshold between 3 and 7- the estimated average processing time is 37  s which corresponds to a maximum mean L1 rate of 27 kHz. Actually, for these trigger conditions, the system occupancy is estimated  % as shown in figure . The mean latency of the L2 trigger in its single FPGA implementation is the average time spent by an event inside the L2 pipeline. This includes steps before (i.e. data reception and data matrix transposition) the sequential processing by the PPC and after (i.e. the proposed multi-FPGA system will obviously provide a larger safety margin in terms of PPC occupancy as well as a shorter latency. In all cases the definite real L1 rate will have to be determined on site. This paper describes the design and implementation of the L2 trigger system for the second phase of the H.E.S.S. The L2 trigger will be used to reject night sky background related and isolated muon events and thus reduce the trigger rate. The principle of the trigger is to build a 2-bit (combined) map of the camera pixels at the time of trigger. The night sky background events can then be rejected by demanding clusters of pixels on the combined map. Further rejection of the hadronic background can be obtained by using quantities such as the center of gravity of the triggered pixels. A possible, illustrative, algorithm for the L2 trigger system has been given in section . The hardware and software integration into the LCT camera of the previously described system based on a single Virtex-4FX12 FPGA has been achieved. The L2 system still needs to be fully integrated in the H.E.S.S. acquisition and tested with real data. The authors are grateful to D. Besin and H. Zaghia for the layout of the cPCI board, to P.

    "article_text_summary": "We present the geometric distortion solutions for the WFC3/UVIS channel, derived from a set of deep images of the core of the Galactic globular cluster @xmath1  Centauri.   The accuracy of the solutions is limited by the lack of enough observations collected at different roll-angles and dithers, and by the uncertainties in the plate-scale variations induced by the velocity aberration of the telescope motion in the Earth-Sun system.   The largest systematics are located in the @xmath0200 pixels closest to the boundaries of the detectors, and never exceed 0.06 pixels.   We advise the use of the inner parts of the detectors for high-precision astrometry.   The comparison of the mid-2002 ACS/WFC positions with the new WFC3 observations corrected with our astrometric solutions is good enough to clearly show the internal motions of @xmath1  Centauri.   The average absolute scale of the detector is also derived.   The solutions are accurate to @xmath00.025 pixel (i.e. @xmath01 mas) over the entire area of each chip.   We also show that the internal motions of @xmath1  Centauri are clearly detected in the residuals of the corrected positions.   We also discuss the limitations of our solutions, and the need for more data to further improve them.  "

    "article_text_summary": "We present a high-resolution simulation of a galaxy merger, which directly resolves the formation of dense structures resembling super star clusters (SSCs) with typical masses of 10^6 solar masses. Comparing their gravitational and kinetic energy, we argue that they are tightly bound and likely progenitors of long-lived globular clusters. We also find that tidal dwarf galaxies of a few 10^8 solar masses are formed in our model, and appear to be a different type of objects, less concentrated and resolved as rotating disks. Our results suggest that both tidal dwarf galaxies and super star clusters can form at the same time in galaxy mergers. The mass function of globular cluster progenitors in this model has a power-law shape with a slope between -2 and -3, likely truncated around 10^6 solar masses. The formation of globular clusters is much more efficient in merging galaxies than in isolated disk models. The total mass of the globular cluster progenitors in our merger model amounts to 4% of the available gas mass, which is 0.7% of the total baryonic mass. The efficiency could be even higher with the large gas fractions observed in high-redshift disks. The material in such regions has been expelled from the spiral disks where it has been previously enriched; it is known to have relatively high metallicities, so the globular clusters formed this way should also be metal-rich. The excess of globular clusters around elliptical and lenticular galaxies compared to spirals could then be explained by this mechanism, given that mergers can form early-type galaxies and globular clusters at the same time."

    "article_text_summary": " we calculate the day - night asymmetry and the recoil electron spectrum for maximal @xmath0 oscillations .   we find that the day - night asymmetry is positive and peaks with a value of about @xmath37 when @xmath38 ev@xmath10 .   the present superkamiokande result@xcite , @xmath39 yields a @xmath40 upper bound of roughly @xmath41 which is plotted as a horizontal line in fig.1 .   we see that the range @xmath42 is disfavoured at the @xmath40 level .   the regions immediately to the side of the disfavoured region will obviously be probed as more data are gathered .   if a positive nonzero value for @xmath32 were to be measured , then an ambiguity would remain in the determination of @xmath2 : values on either side of the presently disfavoured region can produce the same @xmath32 .   this ambiguity could in principle be resolved from a determination of the energy dependence of the night - time rate .   figures 2a and 2b depict the energy dependence of the flux reduction for two representative values of @xmath2 on either side of the disfavoured region .   figure 2a takes @xmath46 ev@xmath10 , with the solid ( dotted ) line showing the ratio of night - time ( day - time ) flux per unit energy to the no - oscillation expectation .   note that the day - time rate is rigorously an energy - independent factor of two less than the no - oscillation rate , while the night - time rate is @xmath47 higher than the day - time rate and is weakly energy - dependent .   figure 2b considers the same quantities for @xmath48 ev@xmath10 .   note that the slopes of the night - time fluxes have opposite signs on opposite sides of the disfavoured region .   the energy dependence becomes unobservably small for @xmath2 values away from the interval around @xmath49 ev@xmath10 .   if the @xmath50 neutrino flux predictions from standard solar models are taken at face value , then superkamiokande has evidence for a distortion in the boron neutrino induced recoil energy spectrum for energies greater than about 13 mev .   more specifically , the spectral anomaly is an excess of events relative to what would be expected on the basis of an energy - independent boron neutrino flux reduction of about @xmath3 .   the observed distortion also disfavours the popular small and large mixing angle msw solutions to the solar neutrino problem .   one can readily identify three possible interpretations of the spectral anomaly : ( i ) standard solar models grossly underestimate the @xmath50 neutrino flux .   ( ii ) there is an as yet unidentified systematic error in the energy resolution function used by superkamiokande , and/or in their energy calibration .   ( iv ) new physics is the cause .   we will not consider ( i ) in this paper , and instead focus on ( iv ) .   before doing so , we briefly discuss ( ii ) as a cautionary note .   figure 3 illustrates the effect of varying the resolution width @xmath51 .   we fit the data by minimising the @xmath52 function @xmath53 ^ 2 + \\left [ { f - 1 \\over \\sigma(f ) } \\right]^2 , \\label{chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the measured recoil electron flux in energy bin @xmath55 , @xmath56 is the theoretical no - oscillation expectation for same , @xmath57 represents an energy independent @xmath3 suppression due ( for instance ) to averaged maximal @xmath0 oscillations and @xmath58 is a boron neutrino flux normalisation parameter to take account of the theoretical uncertainty @xmath59 in this quantity @xcite .   we include the two low energy bins , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as well as the 16 other energy bins used by superkamiokande @xcite .   these data are fitted by varying @xmath58 and the quantity @xmath62 defined through @xmath63 we find the minimum at @xmath64 and @xmath65 , with @xmath66 for @xmath67 degrees of freedom , which is a good fit .   the spectral anomaly becomes an artifact of the finite resolution of the detector .   we can see from fig.3 that a @xmath69 systematic shift upward of @xmath62 would remove the anomaly .   it is interesting to compare this result with fig.1 from ref.   @xcite which shows the effect of an unidentified systematic error in the energy calibration of the detector .   systematic errors in either or both of the energy resolution and energy calibration can in principle explain the spectral anomaly .   having sounded this cautionary note , we now proceed on the basis that superkamiokande have in fact correctly determined their energy resolution and calibration capabilities , and that new physics is behind the spectral anomaly .   it is easy to understand how the spectral anomaly can be explained in a very amusing way through maximal @xmath0 oscillations .   it could be that @xmath2 is such that the transition energy between the averaged oscillation regime and the just - so regime is about 13 mev@xcite !   the spectral anomaly might represent the onset of just - so behaviour .   this would of course be a great piece of luck , but we probably should not disregard the possibility just out of world weary pessimism .   to determine the @xmath2 value required to achieve this effect , the appropriate @xmath52 function is minimised by varying @xmath2 and @xmath58 .

just - so , msw or approximately energy independent .   the day - night asymmetry observable provides for an experimental probe in the msw regime .   the recoil electron energy spectrum and the anomalous seasonal effect likewise provide a probe in the just - so regime .   day - night asymmetry data rule out the range @xmath78 ev@xmath10 for @xmath2 at the @xmath40 level .   a positive measurement of the day - night asymmetry would pin down the preferred value to two possibilities on either side of the disfavoured region , and the energy dependence of the night - time rate could in principle resolve the ambiguity .   the superkamiokande spectral anomaly can be explained in this scenario if @xmath2 takes any of the three or four values corresponding to the local minima in fig.4 .   we have shown that increasing superkamiokande resolution width by @xmath69 would also explain the spectral data .   note from the above that the region @xmath80 ev@xmath10 is without a smoking - gun signature .   of course , another important test of the scenario for the entire @xmath2 range of interest will be the neutral to charged current ratio at sno@xcite : they should obtain the no - oscillation value .   in addition , the borexino @xcite and iodine @xcite experiments will double check the greater than @xmath3 suppression result distilled from the chlorine experiment .   rmc is supported by the commonwealth of australia and the university of melbourne .   , in neutrino 98 , proceedings of the xviii international conference on neutrino physics and astrophysics , takayama , japan , 4 - 9 june 1998 , edited by y. suzuki and y. totsuka ;

Quarks, the elementary substructure particles of the strongly interacting particles, the so-called hadrons, are the basic building blocks of the QGP. The QGP is a new state of matter, predicted to exist at high temperatures and densities. The QGP is a strongly coupled and relativistic plasma, which can be studied in heavy-ion collisions at high-energy accelerators. Theoretical methods to describe the QGP are based on quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory of the strong interaction. The QGP is expected to show collective plasma modes, such as plasmons and plasminos, and to be subject to a thermophoretic force in a mixed phase."

The SNR S147 has a prominent shell structure with a radius of 30 arcmin and is considered to be one of the oldest well-defined SNRs in the galaxy. The pulsar's proper motion measurement clearly associates the pulsar with the SNR. From the separation of the pulsar from the SNR center we determine an age of 30 kyr, making the pulsar significantly younger than is indicated by its characteristic age of 100 kyr. This implies a large initial spin period of 500 ms. The implied possibility of exotic cooling should be revisited after a magnetized atmosphere has been fitted to the recent X-ray data."

We found the motion of the penumbral filaments to exist in two phases: (i) the first phase is short-lived (about 4 minutes) with the time of maximum displacement coinciding with the peak of the microwave flux, and (ii) the second phase is of longer duration (more than 40 minutes). We also observe the patches corresponding to conjugate foot-points in either spots moving towards each other. These conjugate foot-points, labeled as `1' and `2' and marked by arrows, are clearly seen in the online G-band movie.

( parameters in table 1 ) is constrained by the following information : an injection ( uncooled ) lepton spectral index of 2.0 as discussed in section   , the ic normalisation of the vhe cocoon spectrum as provided by   , spindown from   ms to the current period of 89 ms within time   (   to 15 kyr ) , an implied time averaged conversion efficiency of   , and a field strength of   to reproduce the observed vhe break energy .   it is clear that this model ic spectrum agrees relatively well with   measurements ( fig .   1 - thick solid line at very high   energies ) .   the cmbr mostly contributes to this spectrum , whereas higher energy contributions from the galactic fir and starlight photon fields are suppressed due to klein nishina effects .   however , in the next section we will see that the latter two radiation fields contribute significantly to the high energy ic   counterpart of the radio spectrum , where the ic scattering is in the thomson limit .   the lepton spectrum of the cocoon , if self - consistent , should be able to predict the total x - ray spectrum from   .   1 it is clear that the model synchrotron spectrum shows a radiation break around 1 kev (   to   hz ) and predicts the 20 - 300 kev   flux within a factor 2 , although with a steeper spectrum .   the latter is expected to harden if we allow the field strength to increase towards the pulsar in a more sophisticated model incorporating a spatial dependence as well .   to first order we assumed the same field strength (   g ) of the entire structure as found for the cocoon   .   this may not be the case , but by comparing   with high frequency radio observations we should be able to measure the field strength in this extended structure if the high frequency ( radio ) cutoff or turnover can be independently determined .   in this case synchrotron cooling is negligible and the steady state spectrum is given by eqn (   ) .   to reproduce the absolute radio flux ( for a particle index of   ) we had to assume efficiencies of   and 0.45 corresponding to the assumed spectral cutoffs   hz and   hz respectively .   the leptonic parameters corresponding to the latter cutoff is listed in table 1 under `` radio '' .   while the lack of high - frequency radio measurements prohibits a clear constraint on the cutoff of this component ,   observations can constrain the maximum of the spectral energy distribution of leptons in the radio nebula .   these predictions are shown as dashed lines in fig .   the hard lepton spectrum followed by an assumed cutoff at an electron energy   should produce broad   features at three energies :   corresponding to the temperatures   k ( cmbr ) , 25k ( fir ) and   to   k ( starlight ) .   although these energy densities are comparable in the local neighbourhood   , we investigate deviations at the location of vela x: the ( ivs ) of dark clouds and cometary globules centered on (   ,   ) with a radius of   and annular rms width of   is located at a distance   pc   .   with a   m   iras ring flux of   mjy / sr we obtain a luminosity of   erg / s , and assuming a distance of   pc between the ivs center and vela x , we obtain an additional fir energy density of   ev /   at vela x   , which is well below our assumed local averaged energy density .   other potential target photon fields from the vela molecular ridge and gum nebula are located directly behind the vela pulsar   so that the contribution from these local clouds would be severely suppressed by the head - on - tail effect of the ic process , since the   term ( with   small ) in the energy loss rate term is much less than unity .   furthermore , fluctuations in the local distribution of stars can also produce deviations in the starlight energy density at vela x. to investigate this we extracted the   hipparcos   catalog of   stars , of which   have parallax measurements at the   detection level .   this subset was used to calculate the starlight energy density at any 3d field point within   pc from earth .   within   pc from earth we obtain a value of   ev /   , consistent with   , whereas a value of   ev /   is obtained for the vela pwn , with the error reflecting the uncertainty in the distance to the vela pulsar   .   1 , but assuming a mean temperature of 7500 k to account for the stellar types contributing to this excess .   whereas the   webpage ] only lists sensitivities for point sources , we scale the actual   upper limits for the vela x extended source ( extracted from the unpulsed skymaps ) obtained by   by a conservative factor of 30 downward to account for the improved   sensitivity in the same energy bands for an integration time of 1 year .   the   integral   flux upper limits and   sensitivities are shown in fig .   in this paper we have shown that a pulsar birth period of   ms ( to reproduce the observed ratio of pwn to snr radii ) , spinning down within 11 to 15 kyr to the present period of 89 ms while converting   of its spindown power to leptons (   ) in the pwn with a spectral index of 2 , would reproduce the observed   flux in the cocoon via the ic process .   a nebular averaged field strength of   would also reproduce the observed   spectral break , furthermore , this same spectrum predicts the   pds and   total fluxes within a factor of two .   assuming the same   g field strength in the much larger   radio nebula , we need to invoke a second   component with electron spectral index 1.78 and a much larger conversion efficiency   to reproduce the observed total radio spectrum up to at least 8.9 mhz and possibly 30 mhz .   the implication of this second ( radio ) component is the prediction of an ic component at he   covering the same   area south of the pulsar .   the visibility of this component in the he   domain for   is further improved due to the existence of the local fir and starlight target photon fields   , scattered by the highest energy leptons in this second component up to   gev   ( in the thomson limit ) where   has good sensitivity .   2008 , to appear in springer lecture notes on neutron stars and pulsars : 40 years after their discovery , eds .   & gelman , h. 1995 , nature , 375 , 40 mcgee , r.x .

The focus of this paper is to present first results of the HDMS prototype, which operated two ionization high-purity germanium detectors in a unique configuration. The performance of the detectors is discussed in detail, and the last 49 days of data taking are analyzed in terms of WIMP-nucleon cross sections. The status and the prospects of the full-scale experiment are discussed, and conclusions and an outlook are given. The sensitivity of the detectors in their geometrical arrangement was tested by a scan measurement with a collimated Ba-133 source. The achieved energy resolutions and thresholds are shown, along with other detector properties. The background reduction through the anticoincidence between the two detectors is discussed, and the limits on WIMP-nucleon cross sections are given. The future measurement with the Ge-76-HDMS detector will hopefully help to clarify the nature of the structure at 32 keV in the inner detector. The expectation for the Ge-76-HDMS detector is shown. The aim of HDMS is to test the `evidence region' singled out by the DAMA experiment in the MSSM parameter space after about two years of measurement. It would be an independent test by using only raw data and a completely different detection technique."

    "abstract_text": " we have conducted a spectroscopic survey of the inner regions of the sagittarius ( sgr ) dwarf galaxy using the aaomega spectrograph on the anglo - australian telescope .   we determine radial velocities for over 1800 sgr star members in 6 fields that cover an area 18.84 deg@xmath0 , with a typical accuracy of @xmath1 .   motivated by recent numerical models of the sgr tidal stream that predict a substantial amount of rotation in the dwarf remnant core , we compare the kinematic data against n - body models that simulate the stream progenitor as ( i ) a pressure - supported , mass - follows - light system , and ( ii ) a late - type , rotating disc galaxy embedded in an extended dark matter halo .   we find that the models with little , or no intrinsic rotation clearly yield a better match to the mean line - of - sight velocity in all surveyed fields , but fail to reproduce the shape of the line - of - sight velocity distribution .   this result rules out models wherein the prominent bifurcation observed in the leading tail of the sgr stream was caused by a transfer from intrinsic angular momentum from the progenitor satellite into the tidal stream .   it also implies that the trajectory of the young tidal tails has not been affected by internal rotation in the progenitor system .   our finding indicates that new , more elaborate dynamical models , in which the dark and luminous components are treated independently , are necessary for _ simultaneously _ reproducing both the internal kinematics of the sgr dwarf and the available data for the associated tidal stream .

    "article_text_summary": "We present the results of a spectroscopic survey of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy remnant core using the AAOmega instrument at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. We find that the remnant core does not exhibit internal rotation, which is inconsistent with recent models that propose the bifurcation observed in the leading tail of the Sgr stream is due to a transfer of internal angular momentum from the progenitor satellite into the stream. The absence of internal rotation may be consistent with recent theoretical models that propose tidal stirring as the driving mechanism for the formation of the Sgr dwarf. However, although these models are able to reproduce the elongated shape of the Sgr dwarf, as well as the absence of intrinsic angular momentum in the remnant core, they can not explain the presence of a bifurcated tidal tail with the observed characteristics."

The data were obtained as a by-product of the MACHO project, and represent the most extensive coverage of this system to date. We find the light curve to be essentially stable over this period, with no evidence for a significant change in the orbital period. The principal features of the light curves are the deep, extended primary eclipse and a shallower secondary dip at phase 0.5. The eclipse structure is consistent with the presence of an accretion disc bulge, with a bright, irradiated inner surface. The orbital colour shows a pronounced reddening at primary eclipse and a probable smaller effect at phase 0.25, due to the obscuration of the primary/inner disc regions and the irradiated donor star respectively."

Networks are constructed according to a well defined methodology, and results for the logistic map indicate how their properties can be associated to those of the attractor in phase space. Trajectories in distinct dynamical regimes are explored in order to show how the major differences in phase space are reflected in the networks. The networks show several features of small-world and scale-free networks, but they do not fully match with those networks generated by the specific algorithms described in [Phys. Rev. E 65, 066122 (2002)]. The analysis of the networks in the neighborhood of the period-doubling transition reveals that the fractal dimension dependence, measured by D0, has a sharp transition at the onset of chaos. So, the distinct character of the trajectories in phase space is indeed reflected in the network. However, with exception of C, the results for the other indices (, and ) change in a much smoother way with respect to changes in the parameter r."

    "article_text_summary": "we present a relativistic variation of grover s algorithm for quantum search that can be thought of as a procedure for energy transfer between classical objects .   we show that the relativistic version of the algorithm is more efficient than the classical one .   we also discuss the possibility of implementing the procedure in different physical systems and the potential of this new field of relativistic computation .
