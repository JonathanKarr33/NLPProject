rays are thus emitted in a physical proximity to the cold disc .\nx - rays impinging on any cold matter should produce fluorescent emission lines and the continuum \" reflection component  from agn @xcite .\nthe latter feature has indeed been found in observations almost two decades ago ( e.g.\ndue to a high fluorescent yield and abundance of fe among heavy elements in the interstellar medium , the strongest fluorescent line is expected to be the fe k@xmath0  line ( e.g.\n* ) .\n* ) .\nthe reflected spectral components are also expected to be relativistically shifted and broadened , which should be especially noticeable for the case of the fe k@xmath0  line @xcite .\nindeed , broad fe k@xmath0  lines are rather common in the time -

ionised .\nthese regions are covered by optically thick `` skin '' of temperature @xmath1 few kev , where fe and other spectroscopically important metals are completely ionised .\nthe skin thus does not produce the atomic features expected in the less ionised x -

averaged models is usually large as the parameter space of the models is large @xcite .\nbased on such spectra alone one could also suggest that in narrow fe k@xmath0  line agn the innermost region of the disc is truncated and is replaced by a hot quasi - spherical corona , as might be the case in hard state of stellar - mass black hole binary systems @xcite .\ntime - resolved fe k@xmath0  line and x - ray reflection observations are a powerful tool to learn more detail about the geometry in immediate proximity of accreting black holes than possible from time - averaged spectra .\nif x - rays are indeed emitted by separate bright but small and localised magnetic flares , one expects narrow but relativistically shifted fe k@xmath0  lines in snapshot spectra of agn @xcite .\nsuch lines have been observed in a few cases ( e.g.\n* ) despite the challenges of the limited photon statistics , broadly confirming the basic picture of an x - ray source above an cold disc extending very close to the black hole .\nhowever , time - resolved x - ray spectroscopy brought a number of unexpected surprises that present serious challenges to the x - ray reflection / reprocessing paradigm .\na robust theoretical prediction of the model is that a change in the x - ray continuum luminosity should lead to a corresponding variation in the luminosity of the reflected features albeit with a small delay time .\nthis model prediction has not been confirmed in most of the observations suitable for such an analysis .\na lack of fast variability in the fe k@xmath0  line was reported by @xcite for a famous x - ray binary containing a black hole cyg - x1 .\n@xcite showed that fe k@xmath0  line in seyfert 1 galaxy mcg 6 - 30 - 15 does vary on the expected short time scales , but this variability is not correlated to the changes in the x - ray continuum flux .\n@xcite , using observations of 7 agn with the _ rxte _ , find that `` there is no evidence for correlated variability between the line and continuum , severely challenging models in which the line tracks continuum variations modified only by a light - travel time delay '' .\nthey find a decreased amplitude in the fe k@xmath0  line variability as compared to that in the x - ray continuum , similar to the @xcite results for cyg - x1 .\nobservations of other manifestations of x - ray reprocessing pose similar problems .\n@xcite , using a recent _ suzaku _ observations of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg 6 - 30 - 15 , find that variability in the 14 - 45 kev energy band is quenched with respect to that at a few kev .\nthey further find that this is robustly explained by a two - component model , in which the reflection bump , dominating the harder energy band , remains constant while a power - law component varies rapidly .\n@xcite finds similar results for two other sources , mcg-5 - 23 - 16 and ngc 4051 .\n@xcite finds a similarly puzzling absence of a short term variability in the optical that would be correlated to the rapidly varying x - ray emission in the seyfert galaxy ngc 3516 .\nthese authors conclude that their observations challenge the standard x - ray reprocessing paradigm where x - ray emission is partially reflected but mainly reprocessed @xcite into the optical / uv bands .\ntime - dependent changes in the structure of the ionised disc atmosphere may decouple the x - ray flux and the reflected spectrum ( e.g.\n* ) , but a situation in which the reflected continuum appears constant would be very fine tuned .\n@xcite propose that such nominally unexpected spectral behaviour can be explained by the relativistic light bending model @xcite , in which the x - ray emitting source is located above the black hole .\nin this model the intrinsic luminosity of the source is constant but its height above the black hole is changing with time .\ndue to strong relativistic effects , the observed flux can vary by more than one order of magnitude , whereas the reflected spectrum is far less variable as the relativistic effects are not as severe .\n@xcite confirm the relativistic bending results of @xcite , and propose another model , in which the reflecting medium is highly inhomogeneous .\nin this paper we explore an alternative and rather simple explanation for the worrying uncorrelated variability of the x - ray continuum and the reflected features .\nwe argue that x - ray emission from realistic magnetic flare structures should be expected to be anisotropic .\nthese flares must rotate with the disc material as the magnetic flux tubes are anchored into the disc , and hence a distant observer would see the flare under a time - dependent angle .\nunless the emitting region is ( very ) optically thin , the observer then witnesses a varying x - ray flux even if the angle - integrated power output in the flare is constant .\nat the same time , the reflected spectrum would remain constant because this component should be axially symmetric .\nmagnetic flares occurring on the surface of the sun are believed to have very complex geometry ( e.g.\nin general , emission region consists of several flux tubes possibly interacting with each other .\nthere is no spherical or axial symmetry in this case .\nit is hard to see why magnetic flares on the surface of an accretion disc would be any more symmetric than solar flares .\nwe shall now argue that even if emission within the source is locally isotropic , the resulting emission is anisotropic for a mildly optically thick flare .\nconsider a line of sight passing through an emitting region to the observer .\nthe standard radiative transfer equation shows that the specific radiation intensity emerging from the region is @xmath2 + \\int_0^{\\tau } d\\tau ' s(\\tau ' ) \\exp\\left[-\\tau'\\right]\\ ; , \\label{general}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the total optical depth of the region along the line of sight , @xmath4 is the radiation intensity entering the region , and @xmath5 is the source function .\nwe assume that the emitting region is located above the cold disc that emits no x - rays @xcite , and hence we shall set @xmath6 in the x - ray domain .\nfor an optically thin source , @xmath7 , we have @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the photon mean free path , @xmath10 , and the integral is taken over @xmath11 as long as @xmath11 is within the source .\nthe x - ray flux from the source is obtained by integrating equations 1 or 2 over the whole projected surface area of the source visible to the observer .\nequation 2 yields @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the 3d coordinate and the integration is now taken over the three - dimensional volume of the source ( we omit the solid angle of the detector as seen from the source ; this factor is obviously constant ) .\nif the source function is isotropic , we see that the flux emitted in any direction is the same for an optically thin source .\nthis conclusion holds for an arbitrary geometry of the source as long as @xmath14 .\nhowever , radiation transfer models require thomson optical depths of the order of @xmath15 to explain the observed x - ray continuum @xcite .\nin this case , the approximate equality [ tau0 ] is no longer valid .\nthe amount of radiation emitted in a given direction depends on the typical value of the optical depth @xmath3 in that direction , even if the source function itself is isotropic ,    detailed polarised radiation transfer calculations for cylindric and hemispheric emitting regions were performed by @xcite .\nthe axis of symmetry of the regions were perpendicular to the reflector ( disc ) in these calculations .\nthe results showed , among other important conclusions , that the resulting x - ray emission strongly depends on the viewing angle .\nfor example , their figure 2 , panel b , shows that emission of a hemisphere with thomson optical depth @xmath3 as small as 0.07 is very different for a pole - on and an edge - on views .\nit is very obvious to us that if the axis of symmetry of the hemisphere were tilted away from the symmetry axis of the disc , the emission would also depend on the azimuthal angle @xmath16 defined in the plane of the reflector .\nwe conclude that if magnetic flares on the surface of the disc are anything like those observed on the surface of the sun and have @xmath17 , then x - ray emission flux is guaranteed to be anisotropic .\nmore specifically , the emission will depend on both the inclination angle of the disc to the observer and the orbital phase of the flare as seen by the observer .\nat the same time , the emission from the atmosphere of the disc illuminated by x - rays from above ( e.g.\n, * ?\n, * ?\n, * ?\n, * ?\n, * ?\n, * ?\n, * ?\n, * ?\n* ; * ?\n* ; * ?\n* ; * ?\n* ; * ?\n* ; * ?\n* ; * ?\n* ; * ?\n* ; * ?\n* ) is not expected to depend on the azimuthal angle ( neglecting relativistic effects ) .\nthe reflected emission does depend on the inclination angle of the disc ( e.g.\n* ?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n?\n* ) , but this angle is not expected to vary for a given source .\nhence , if a constant energy release rate magnetic flare rotates together with the disc region underneath it , the observer will see a varying x - ray continuum flux and a constant x - ray reflection flux .\nwe made a very simple point in this paper , emphasising the potential importance of anisotropy of x - ray emitters in accreting black holes .\none prediction of this model is an uncorrelated x - ray variability of the continuum and the reflected features on time scales shorter than a dynamical time ( @xmath18 , where r is the radius at the location of the flare , and @xmath19 is the black hole mass ) , as observed in a number of cases .\nwe do not expect the model to be applicable to variability on time scales longer than the dynamical time .\nmagnetic loop s foot - points are expected to follow the motion of the differentially rotating disc .\none therefore suspects the loops to be significantly deformed on the local dynamical time .\ntherefore , magnetic flux tube s emissivity is likely to evolve on this time scale rather than remain constant .\nin other words , on time scales longer than a local dynamical time , variability in the total number of flares or their emissivity would be more important than the effects we discussed .\nour model for the uncorrelated x - ray variability of the continuum and the reflected features could also work if an anisotropic x - ray source is placed on the disc symmetry axis , as in the light bending model of @xcite .\nin that case the source must rotate ( i.e.\ndue to the black hole spin ) but can remain at a constant height above the black hole ."}, {"article_id": "astro-ph0107091", "abstract_text": " this review aims to give a summary of our understanding of galaxy evolution as infered from studies of nearby galaxies ; how observations made with the _ hubble space telescope _ have contributed significantly to our detailed understanding of the older stellar populations in local group dwarf galaxies .   recent results from vlt are also promising interesting future prospects for the study of resolved stellar populations in nearby dwarf galaxies .      = 23.5 cm = 16.5 cm = 0.46 cm = 0.pt = 0.pt = -0.54 cm = -0.54 cm    ps .   @plainmkbothoddheadoddfoot``dwarf galaxies and their environment '' ; international conference in bad honnef , germany , 23 -

redshift , because otherwise we do nt know which type of galaxies we may be viewing .\nthere are currently numerous techniques available to uncover information buried in the properties of individual stars .\nit will make a significant difference in the interpretation of galaxy surveys if they preferentially detect populations of star - bursting dwarf galaxies - which do not trace the mass distribution in the universe - or if the galaxies we detect are massive spirals or ellipticals which do .\nwe thus have to understand how different types of galaxies evolve so we are able to distinguish their progenitors in redshift surveys .\nit must be fair to assume that all the galaxies we see today in and around our local group are broadly representative ; our region of space is neither over - dense ( a cluster environoment ) nor under - dense ( in a void ) .\nall nearby galaxies have doubtless been forming and evolving for a significant fraction of the age of the universe .\nif this were not true it would mean that our local region of space is in some way peculiar , and there is no evidence for this .\nthus , as new techniques and instruments enable us to determine more and more accurate star formation histories for nearby galaxies over 90% of the lifetime of the universe we can hope to obtain a representative picture of galaxy evolution from our local neighbourhood , and with it the ability to predict what galaxies look like at all redshifts .\ndetailed studies of nearby galaxies will thus provide an independent method to compare with redshift survey predictions .\nit is apparent that some galaxies have a more or less constant global star formation rate through time ( _ e.g.\n_ spirals ) and some appear to be subject to sudden , intense _ bursts _ of star formation ( _ e.g.\n_ irregulars ) and then some stopped forming stars entirely at some point in the past ( _ e.g.\nfilling in the crucial details of this basic scenario requires the detailed analysis of the fossil record of ancient star formation .\nthe most detailed information on how a galaxy has evolved in time comes from measuring the star - formation rate as a function of time , or the star formation history ( sfh ) , and the most direct and unambiguous method of doing this comes from interpreting cmds of a significant fraction of the individual stars in a galaxy .\nthis is a plot of the temperature versus the luminosity of all the stars bright enough to be detected in a galaxy in the observed quantities of colour and magnitude ( see figure  1 ) .\nbecause of our detailed understanding of stellar properties these measurements can be converted into physical parameters such as age ( or sfh ) , chemical composition and enrichment history , initial mass function , environment , and dynamical history of a system .\nsome of these parameters are strongly correlated , such as chemical composition and age , since successive generations of stars may be progressively enriched in the heavier elements .\nthus , detailed numerical simulations of cmd morphology are necessary to disentangle the complex effects of different stellar populations overlying each other and make an effective quantitative analysis of possible sfhs .\nto this end there have been numerous recent developments in crowded field photometry techniques and advanced methods of interpreting highly populous and detailed cmds from nearby galaxies ( e.g.\n, tosi _ et al .\n_ 1991 ; tolstoy & saha 1996 ; aparicio _ et al .\n_ 1996 ; dolphin 1997 ; dohm - palmer _ et al .\n_ 1997 ; hernandez _ et al .\nthe exquisite stable high spatial resolution combined with photometric accuracy of images from the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) have allowed us to probe further back into the history of star formation of a large variety of different galaxy types with widely differing star formation properties , and extend our studies out to the edges of the local group and beyond with greater accuracy than ever before .\nwe have learnt several important things about dwarf galaxy evolution from these studies .\nfirstly we have found that no two galaxies have identical star formation histories ; some galaxies may superficially look the same today , but they have invariably followed a different paths to this point .\nnow that we have managed to probe deep into the star formation history of dwarf irregular galaxies in the local group it is obvious that there are a number of similarities in their global properties with those of dwarf elliptical / spheroidal type galaxies , which were previously thought to be quite distinct .\nhowever , the elliptical / speheroidals tend to have one or more discrete episodes of star formation through - out their history and dwarf irregulars are characterised by quasi - continuous star - formation .\nthe previous strong dichotomy between these two classes has been weakened by these new results and may stem from the differences in the environment in which these similar mass galaxies were born into or have inhabited for most of their lives .\nif we want to understand the detailed chemical enrichment of galaxies by their constituent stars , we need to accurately measure the relative abundances of a range of different elements in high resolution spectra .\nto date most metallicity determinations for stars in nearby galaxies ( and there are nt many ) have been derived either from single chemical element studies from low resolution spectra ( see figure  2 ) or from broad - band photometry , and these are at best simple estimates .\nthus in spite of considerable efforts with 4 m class telescopes , many of the most basic questions remain unanswered for most of the local group galaxies : what is the total range in [ fe / h ] for stars within a galaxy ?\ndoes the [ fe / h ] match that of the milky way halo populations ( globular clusters or field stars ) ?\ndo the elemental ratios ( particularly [ @xmath0/fe ] and [ r- and s- process / fe ] ratios ) in nearby systems track those seen in the metal poor field or in the globular clusters ?\nresults from high resolution spectra taken with hires at the keck observatory , have started to answer these detailed questions about the enrichment _ history _ of a variety of different elements within galaxies other than our own ( e.g.\nshetrone _ et al .\n_ 1998 ; shetrone _ et al .\n_ 2001 ; venn _ et al .\nthe new eso _ very large telescope _ ( vlt ) observatory on paranal in chile consists of four 8 m diameter mirror telescopes and a slew of modern instrumentation .\nthe large collecting area and the high resolution spectrograph ( uves ) allows us , amongst other things , to spectroscopically determine the abundances of a large variety of elements for individual stars ( e.g.\n, hill _ et al .\n_ 2000 ; primas _ et al .\nrecent results of uves spectroscopy of stars of known age in a dwarf galaxy cmd are shown in figure  3 .\nby looking at galaxies outside our own we gain the advantages of perspective and thus we have a better chance to build up a complete picture of metallicity variations over time .\nthe most interesting stars , to get a large range in age , are faint enough in external galaxies to require an 8 m telescope .\nincluding chemical evolution history in cmd analysis will result in a significant improvement in our understanding of how galaxies evolve .\nfor example , rather than just measuring a single present day end - product abundance of an element , we can select individual stars of different ages from imaging data and _ measure _ how the enrichment of many different elements has varied with time .\nthis means we can measure how the chemical composition of the interstellar medium , the basic building material for future stellar populations , is altered by successive generations of stars .\ndeep , precision , multi - colour photometry in combination with spectroscopic metallicity measurements of the individual stars in external galaxies can uniquely determine the star formation histories of nearby galaxies going back many giga - years .\nthese studies make clear the potential of deeper data , from vlt and new hst instruments , for a range of galaxy types .\nwe are currently ( apparently ) in the embarrassing situation of , at least claiming to , understand the properties of distant high - redshift galaxies better than those in the nearby universe .\nit is only with the arrival of large telescopes with excellent image quality and high through - put spectrographs that we can start to make really detailed comparisons between the properties of distant and nearby galaxies .\nthis is because the individual low mass ( old ) stars in the nearby universe which formed when the universe was young ( at high redshift ) are faint .\nthus to see them in galaxies external to our own requires at least an 8 m class telescope .\nthere are a number of ways in which the current interpretation of cmds can be dramatically improved .\none is more and deeper cmds of a larger sample of nearby galaxies .\nit is still most efficient to use hst to obtain deep cmds to study the old main sequence turnoffs , but large scale surveys , down the magnitude of the horizontal branch can better be carried out with ground - based telescopes such as the vlt ( see figure  1 ) .\nwhen galaxies are satellites of our own milky way , they are typically close enough that excellent results can best be achieved using wide field imagers on 2 m class telescopes ( e.g.\nmpa / eso/2.2 m wfi on la silla or the int / wfc on la  palma ) , of which there have been some nice results shown at this conference .\ni believe that the most important contributions will come from continuing the effort to improve our ability to interpret the details in cmds .\nthere will be significant progress when we have measured abundances of a large variety of elements for stars of known age for individual stars in a cmd .\nthe observed redshift distribution of faint galaxies detected in deep uv / optical imaging surveys has been assumed to trace the star formation history of the universe ( e.g.\n, madau _ et al .\nthe majority of these galaxies are at intermediate redshift ( @xmath1 ) , late type , intrinsically small , and undergoing a strong `` burst '' of star formation .\nthis means that the nearby universe ( the local group ) must contain clearly identifiable remnants from this relatively recent epoch @xmath2  gyr before present ( i.e.\ncorresponding to @xmath3  0.5@xmath41 ) when the peak in the universal star formation rate is predicted to occur .\ninitial comparisons suggest that studies of nearby galaxies _ do not _ yield the same sfh as is inferred from optical redshift surveys ( _ e.g.\nhowever , the best present day candidates for this intermediate redshift galaxy population are the extremely numerous but presently faint ( dwarf ) irregular galaxies which have not yet been studied in sufficient detail .\nit is also true to say that although we know that nearby spirals and especially ellipticals have very large old stellar populations it is difficult to be very precise beyond about @xmath5  gyr ago ( corresponding to a redshift range z@xmath6 ) with current data .\nthis is all going to change dramatically with large telescopes and more sensitive instruments .\nsub - mm / radio wavelength surveys are also pointing to sfhs very different from those implied by optical data ( e.g.\n, blain _ et al .\n_ 1999 ) , and these surveys suggest a much larger type of galaxy ( _ e.g.\n_ , ellipticals ) which are typically at higher redshift ( @xmath7 ) .\na complete survey of the resolved stellar populations in the local universe will accurately trace star formation variations within both large and small galaxies , and determine if and when bursts of star formation occur and how long they last .\nit might well be that optical redshift surveys are strongly biased towards low mass dwarf irregular galaxies undergoing short bursts of star formation , and that they are thus not accurate indicators of the dominant mode ( by mass ) of star formation in the universe which occurs in much larger galaxies .\nthe more detailed is our understanding of star formation processes and their effect on galaxy evolution in the nearby universe the better we will understand the results from studies of the integrated light of galaxies in the high - redshift universe ."}]
