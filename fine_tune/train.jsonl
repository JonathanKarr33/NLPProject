[ fig : lc_ex ] ( where each detection corresponds to a flare on scw timescale ) . we define waiting - time ( wt ) between two consecutive flares , the difference between the start times of two subsequent scws where a sfxt flare is detected . the shortest waiting - time corresponds to the duration of a scw ( in case of flares detected in adjacent scws ) . in fig . [ fig : wt ] we show the cumulative distribution of waiting - times between `` consecutive '' flares , for each of the three targets .    the highly populated vertical lines in fig .  [ fig : wt ] , corresponding to the shortest waiting - time ( below 0.1 days ) , are produced by flares detected in adjacent scws . at the opposite side of the x - axis , waiting - times larger than 100  days might be significantly affected by the data gaps between two satellite visibility windows of the source sky position , as suggested by the steepening of the waiting - time distribution above 100  days , particularly evident in  and . other biases due to gaps in the data are unlikely to severily affect the shape of the true distribution at intermediate waiting - times ( between a few days and 100  days ) , given the low duty cycles of these three sfxts .    an interesting feature present in all three waiting - time distributions is a plateau just above @xmath01  day ( i.e. missing waiting - times in that temporal range ) . this strongly suggests that a waiting - time of @xmath01  day ( 1.4  day , to be precise , in order to include the last point of the plateau in ) can be adopted as a timescale to separate the flaring activity belonging to two different and subsequent outbursts ( each composed by a cluster of many flares ) . this makes it possible to derive the time duration of single outbursts and to study their statistical properties ( e.g. , cumulative distribution ) and correlations . in order to determine the total duration of a bright x  ray flaring activity episode ( a single outburst ) as observed by /ibis , we adopt the following procedure : for each sfxt , we start from the second x  ray flare detected in the /ibis light curve and calculate its waiting - time with respect to the first flare . if this waiting - time is lower than 1  day , then the flare is assumed to belong to the same bright outburst phase as the previous flare . performing this comparison with the following flares , at one point there will be a flare for which the waiting - time with respect to the immediatly previous flare is greater than 1 day . at this point the procedure stops and a list of clusters of flares ( i.e. outburst ) is produced for the three sfxts . this automatic process has led to the empirical determination of the duration of the sfxts outbursts , as observed by . to do this , we defined two different temporal quantities : the _ total duration _ ( d ) of the brightest phase of an outburst and the _ elapsed time interval _ ( @xmath11 t ) between the first and the last flare belonging to an outburst ( see fig . [ fig : lc_ex ] , upper panel and caption , for an example ) . more in detail : for each source , for each single outburst , we calculated the total duration ( d ) simply by adding together the durations , d@xmath12 , of single flares belonging to the same outburst ( d=@xmath13 , where n is the number of flares in a single outburst ) . since the flares composing an outburst can be either detected in adjacent pointings or not , d can be interpreted as the integrated time each sfxt spends in its brightest state during a single outburst as observed by ibis . durations d lower than 2 - 3  ks imply that only one isolated flare is caught by  during a supposed ( although unobserved ) longer outburst . very likely , these single flares represent the brightest activity of outburts with average fainter luminosity , where  detects only the brightest part . another temporal quantity that can be calculated from the light curves of x  ray flares , for each outburst , is the elapsed time interval , @xmath11 t ( where @xmath11t = tstop@xmath14-tstart@xmath15 ) between the first ( `` 1 '' ) and the last ( `` n '' ) flare belonging to the same outburst ( as previously defined ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ lstab : fit ]    finally , it is interesting to note that the behaviour of the three prototypical sfxts discussed here during the bright phase of their outbursts is very similar , irrespective of the wide range of orbital periods covered ( @xmath05 , 30 and 51 days ; ps14 , @xcite ) , likely due to both the intrinsic wind properties and to the mediating role of the shell above the ns magnetosphere , in the settling accretion scenario . we have performed a characterization of the temporal properties of x  ray flares from the three most extreme sfxts , as observed by  in the energy band 1750 kev , obtaining more insights into the physics producing their outbursts .    calculating the cumulative distribution of waiting - times between the x  ray flares , we were able to identify the typical timescale that clearly separates different outbursts , composed by several single flares at @xmath0ks timescale . this selection allowed us to calculate the energy emitted during sfxt outbursts , finding an interesting correlation with the outburst duration .    in the framework of the quasi - spherical settling accretion we have discussed here , the outburst properties ( total emitted energy , duration and their positive correlation ) carry signatures of the magnetized wind structure of the companion : an sfxt outburst is composed by a chain of x  ray flares physically connected to one large region of magnetized stellar wind that triggers the ns magnetospheric instability by means of magnetic reconnection . the power - law slope of the correlation between total emitted energy and duration of the sfxt outbursts can be explained by the fractal structure of the ob - supergiant winds , reflecting the size distribution of magnetized clouds in the wind of the ob - supergiant companions . based on observations with _ integral _ , an esa project with instruments and science data centre funded by esa member states ( especially the pi countries : denmark , france , germany , italy , spain , and switzerland ) , czech republic and poland , and with the participation of russia and the usa . this work has made use of the  archive developed at inaf - iasf milano , http://www.iasf-milano.inaf.it/@xmath0ada/golia.html . ls and ap acknowledge the italian space agency financial support integral asi / inaf agreement n. 2013 - 025.r.0 , and the grant from prin - inaf 2014 , `` towards a unified picture of accretion in high mass x - ray binaries '' ( pi : sidoli ) . the work of kp is partially supported by rfbr grant 14 - 02 - 00657 . we thank the anonymous referee whose suggestions helped improve and clarify the manuscript . i. , smith d.  m. , reig p. , chaty s. , torrejn j.  m. , 2006 , in proc . of the `` the x - ray universe 2005 '' , 26 - 30 september 2005 , el escorial , madrid , spain . ed . by a. wilson . esa sp-604 , volume 1 , noordwijk : esa pub . division , isbn 92 - 9092 - 915 - 4 , 2006 "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " we have characterized the typical temporal behaviour of the bright x  ray flares detected from the three supergiant fast x    ray transients showing the most extreme transient behaviour ( , , ) .   we focus here on the cumulative distributions of the waiting - time ( time interval between two consecutive x  ray flares ) , and the duration of the hard x  ray activity ( duration of the brightest phase of an sfxt outburst ) , as observed by /ibis in the energy band 1750 kev . adopting the cumulative distribution of waiting - times   , it is possible to identify the typical timescale that clearly separates different outbursts , composed by several single flares at @xmath0ks timescale .   this allowed us to measure the duration of the brightest phase of the outbursts from these three targets , finding that they show heavy - tailed cumulative distributions .   we observe a correlation between the total energy emitted during sfxt outbursts and the time interval covered by the outbursts ( defined as the elapsed time between the first and the last flare belonging to the same outburst as observed by @xmath1 ) .   we show that temporal properties of flares and outbursts of the sources , which share common properties regardless different orbital parameters , can be interpreted in the model of magnetized stellar winds with fractal structure from the ob - supergiant stars .

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an abstract creator who takes in papers and generates good scientific abstracts"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Make an abstract for the following paper: \nthe automatic extraction of acronyms and their meaning from corpora is an important sub - task of text mining . we will refer to it by the term _ acronym - meaning extraction_.    much work has been done on it . to mention just some : matched an acronym against a text chunk , thus producing different candidate definitions for the acronym . they alternatively tried heuristic approaches , naive bayes learning , and compression ( i.e. , shortest description length ) to select the best candidate . added shallow parsing , and matched an acronym against a parsed ( i.e. , structured ) text chunk . used a heuristic algorithm to deterministically find an acronym s meaning the task can bes seen as a special case of string alignment between a text chunk and an acronym . for example , the text chunk `` they have many hidden markov models '' can be aligned with the acronym `` hmms '' in different ways , such as `` they have many * h*idden * m*arkov * m*odel*s * '' or `` t*h*ey have * m*any hidden * m*arkov model*s * '' . alternative alignments have different cost , and ideally the least costly one should give the correct meaning of the acronym . string alignment admits in general four different edit operations : insertion , deletion , substitution , and preservation of a letter @xcite . in the case of acronym - meaning extraction , only deletion and preservation can occur . string alignment has a worst - case time complexity of @xmath0 , with @xmath1 and @xmath2 being the lengths of the two aligned strings , respectively . this also holds for the present special case . the purpose of this report is to show how the alignment - based approach to acronym - meaning extraction can be implemented by means of a 3-tape weighted finite - state machine ( 3-wfsm ) . the 3-wfsm will read a text chunk on tape 1 and an acronym on tape 2 , and generate all possible alignments on tape 3 , inserting dots to mark which letters are used in the acronym . for the above example this would give `` they have many .hidden .markov .model.s '' , among others . the 3-wfsm can be automatically generated from a clear and relatively simple regular expression that defines the task in as much detail as we wish . both the generation and the application of the 3-wfsm are done by ( more or less ) standard operations @xcite , that are available in finite - state tools such as wfsc @xcite . no additional algorithms are required at any stage , which reduces the development time to a few hours . using basic unix utilities , we first extract from a corpus all sentences that contain acronyms in brackets , such as    between a hidden markov model ( hmm ) and a weighted finite - state +    ' '' ''    automaton ( wfsa ) there is a correspondence . +    then , we split these sentences into pairs consisting of an acronym and the text chunk that precedes it ( starting from the sentence beginning or form the preceding acronym , respectively ) . for the above example , this is    between a hidden markov model    ' '' ''    hmm + and a weighted finite - state automaton    ' '' ''    wfsa     +    next , we normalize these pairs : capital letters are transformed into small ones , and separators into underscores :    between_a_hidden_markov_model    ' '' ''    hmm + and_a_weighted_finite_state_automaton    ' '' ''    wfsa     + we start by compiling a 4-wfsm over the real tropical semiring @xmath3 , from the expression @xmath4    where @xmath5 is a _ symbol class _ accepting any symbol except underscore , @xmath6 represents the empty string , @xmath7 a constraint requiring the different @xmath5 on tapes @xmath8 to @xmath9 to be instantiated by the same symbol @xcite , and the @xmath10 s are weights . we use a superscript @xmath11 to indicate the arity of a @xmath12-wfsm @xcite .    if we apply @xmath13 with tapes 1 and 2 to a normalized text chunk and a corresponding acronym , respectively , and generate ( neutrally - weighted ) alternative analyses from tapes 3 and 4 , we obtain , for example    .... 1,2 > they_have_many_hidden_markov_models       hmms    3,4 > t.hey_have_.many_hidden_.markov_model.s     iaii_iiii_aiii_iiiiii_aiiiii_iiiiia      0 3,4 > t.hey_have_.many_hidden_markov_.model.s     iaii_iiii_aiii_iiiiii_iiiiii_aiiiia      0 3,4 > t.hey_have_many_hidden_.markov_.model.s     iaii_iiii_iiii_iiiiii_aiiiii_aiiiia      0 3,4 > they_.have_.many_hidden_.markov_model.s     iiii_aiii_aiii_iiiiii_aiiiii_iiiiia      0 3,4 > they_.have_.many_hidden_markov_.model.s     iiii_aiii_aiii_iiiiii_iiiiii_aiiiia      0 3,4 > they_.have_many_hidden_.markov_.model.s     iiii_aiii_iiii_iiiiii_aiiiii_aiiiia 0 3,4 > they_have_many_.hidden_.markov_.model.s     iiii_iiii_iiii_aiiiii_aiiiii_aiiiia      0 ....    on tape 3 , letters of the text chunk which are used in the acronym , are preceded by a dot . tape 4 shows the performed operations : a meaning `` acronym letter '' , i meaning `` ignored letter '' . all analyses have neutral weight 0 .    by means of xfst @xcite we generate from the following regular expression a 2-fsm ( i.e. , a non -

[ \\end{verbatim } } \\end{minipage}\\ ] ]    in this expression , all word - initial i are replaced by u ( `` unused word '' ) if no letter of this word is used in the acronym , but if letters of preceding words are used . then , all i of a used word are replaced by g ( `` gap letter '' ) if they are followed by an a ( `` acronym letter '' ) in the same word . next , word - initial g are replaced by g ( `` word - initial gap letter '' ) . finally , all a are replaced by a number 1 to 8 , expressing their position in the word . positions higher than 8 are marked as 8 . furthermore , we generate with xfst another 2-fsm , @xmath16 , that deletes all letters of leading unused words , and the adjacent underscores : @xmath17    these two non - weighted 2-fsms are transformed into 2-wfsms , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , with neutral weight , and are joined @xcite with the previously compiled 4-wfsm @xmath13  : @xmath20    in the resulting @xmath21 , we have a modified form of tape 3 on tape 5 ( describing analyses ) , and a modified form of tape 4 on tape 6 ( describing operations ) . if we apply tape 1 to a normalized text chunk and tape 2 to a corresponding acronym , we obtain from tapes 5 and 6 for example    .... 1,2 > they_have_many_hidden_markov_models      hmms    5,6 > t.hey_have_many_hidden_.markov_.model.s    g2ii_uiii_uiii_uiiiii_1iiiii_1gggg6      0 5,6 > t.hey_have_.many_hidden_markov_.model.s    g2ii_uiii_1iii_uiiiii_uiiiii_1gggg6      0 5,6 > t.hey_have_.many_hidden_.markov_model.s    g2ii_uiii_1iii_uiiiii_1iiiii_ggggg6      0 5,6 >       .have_many_hidden_.markov_.model.s    iiii_1iii_uiii_uiiiii_1iiiii_1gggg6      0 5,6 >       .have_.many_hidden_markov_.model.s    iiii_1iii_1iii_uiiiii_uiiiii_1gggg6      0 5,6 >       .have_.many_hidden_.markov_model.s    iiii_1iii_1iii_uiiiii_1iiiii_ggggg6      0 5,6 > .hidden_.markov_.model.s    iiii_iiii_iiii_1iiiii_1iiiii_1gggg6      0 ....    finally , we assign costs ( i.e. , weights ) to the different operations by means of a 1-wfsm generated from the expression @xmath22    here we chose the costs by intuition . in an improved approach they could be estimated from data .    to obtain our acronym - meaning extractor , we join @xmath23 with the previously compiled @xmath21 : @xmath24    if we apply @xmath25 with tapes 1 and 2 to a text chunk and a corresponding acronym , respectively , we obtain from tapes 5 and 6 for example    .... 1,2 > they_have_many_hidden_markov_models      hmms    5,6 > t.hey_have_many_hidden_.markov_.model.s    g2ii_uiii_uiii_uiiiii_1iiiii_1gggg6      17 5,6 > t.hey_have_.many_hidden_markov_.model.s    g2ii_uiii_1iii_uiiiii_uiiiii_1gggg6      17 5,6 > t.hey_have_.many_hidden_.markov_model.s    g2ii_uiii_1iii_uiiiii_1iiiii_ggggg6      18 5,6 >       .have_many_hidden_.markov_.model.s    iiii_1iii_uiii_uiiiii_1iiiii_1gggg6      11 5,6 >       .have_.many_hidden_markov_.model.s iiii_1iii_1iii_uiiiii_uiiiii_1gggg6      11 5,6 >       .have_.many_hidden_.markov_model.s    iiii_1iii_1iii_uiiiii_1iiiii_ggggg6      12 5,6 >                 .hidden_.markov_.model.s iiii_iiii_iiii_1iiiii_1iiiii_1gggg6       7 ....    we select the analysis with the lowest cost by means of a classical single - source best - path algorithm such as dijkstra s algorithm @xcite or bellman - ford s @xcite . if our weights have been optimally chosen , we should now obtain the correct analysis .    in practice , input is read on tapes 1 and 2 and output generated from tapes 2 and 5 , as in the following examples . all other tapes can therefore be removed , leaving us with a 3-wfsm @xmath26 .    .... 1,2 > they_have_many_hidden_markov_models     hmms 1,2 > between_hidden_markov_models            hmms 1,2 > and_weighted_finite_state_automata      wfsa 1,2 > and_weighted_finite_state_automata      wfa    2,5 > hmms     .hidden_.markov_.model.s 2,5 > hmms     .hidden_.markov_.model.s 2,5 > wfsa     .weighted_.finite_.state_.automata 2,5 > wfa      .weighted_.finite_state_.automata .... we tested the acronym -

section measurements allow the extraction of information about the strong coupling constant @xmath1 and probes qcd at scales sensitive to new physics . the atlas detector @xcite at lhc @xcite is a multi - purpose particle physics detector with a forward - backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and nearly 4@xmath2 coverage in solid angle . it consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 t axial magnetic field , electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters , and a muon spectrometer . the inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity range @xmath3 2.5 . photons are reconstructed from energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter with transverse energy in towers of @xmath4 cells in @xmath5 . reconstructed photons are selected for analyses using identification and isolation criteria . photon identification is used to reject hadronic background by applying requirements on the energy leaking into the hadronic calorimeter and on the shower - shape variables . the `` tight '' selection is optimised to reduce the contribution from jets with one or more hard @xmath6 decaying to photons and carrying most of the jet energy . photon isolation is based on isolation energy ( @xmath7 ) . a photon is considered isolated if its @xmath7 is less than some isolation cut value . the @xmath7 is based on the energy measured in topological clusters within a cone of radius r=0.4 with the core of the cone removed . in the photon measurements presented here , the cut is . prompt photons , which represent the signal in the analysis , can belong to two different groups - direct photons and fragmentation photons . direct photons originate from the hard processes . fragmentation photons are emitted in the fragmentation of a high transverse momentum parton . the measurement of isolated prompt photon cross - section at @xcite is based on of data collected in 2012 . events are selected according the following criteria : each event is required to have a reconstructed vertex consistent with the average beam - spot position , where the vertex is required to have at least two associated tracks . photons are required to have @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 gev . they are triggered using single photon triggers with thresholds 20 , 40 , 60 , 80 , 100 , and 120 gev . data taken by these triggers are multiplied by appropriate prescales and combined together . tight isolated photons are considered as signal here . the background is subtracted using the so - called 2d sideband method . the purpose of this method is to remove the residual background from meson decays and jets . it is based on isolation and identification criteria . in this method , photons are divided into four regions ( a : tight and isolated ; b : tight and non -

[ scheme ] . state @xmath1 is the state to be discriminated . states @xmath2 are the program states . our task is to find whether @xmath3 . as shown in ref . @xcite if the intensity transmittance of beam splitter bs@xmath4 , @xmath5 and the transmittance of beam splitter bs@xmath6 , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the intensity transmittance of beam splitter bs@xmath9 ( we suppose that the reflectances and transmittances add to unity , @xmath10 ) , then one can unambiguously identify the incoming state just by photodetection at detectors d@xmath4 and d@xmath6 . if d@xmath4 clicks we can conclude that @xmath11 , if d@xmath6 clicks it means that @xmath12 . if neither of the detectors clicks we can not make any conclusion about the state @xmath1  this situation corresponds to an inconclusive result . in an ideal situation both detectors may never click in coincidence . the probability of correct identification of state @xmath13 reads @xmath14 and of correct identification of state @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 denote the detection efficiencies . in this paper we assume the equal prior probabilities of both coherent states @xmath13 and @xmath15 . in such a case the optimal choice of the splitting ratios is shown to be @xmath18 ( independently of the input states ) @xcite .    in a real setup it sometimes happens that detectors d@xmath4 and d@xmath6 click simultaneously . practically these double clicks , as well as no detections , correspond to inconclusive results because we can not distinguish whether the unknown state was equal to state @xmath13 , or to state @xmath15 . all other situations , when just one of detectors clicks , belong to conclusive results . they include both correct and erroneous identifications of the unknown state . ideally , the erroneous identifications never occur and the probability of a conclusive result is equal to the probability of correct identification . the experimental setup ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) was built up on fiber optics . for preparation of coherent states we used strongly attenuated pulses produced by a laser diode at wavelength 826  nm and with a length of pulses around 4  ns . pulses were divided by a fiber coupler into three optical fibers , each corresponding to one of states @xmath13 , @xmath15 , @xmath1 . amplitudes of coherent states were adjusted together by a digital attenuator located in front of pulse splitting and separately for individual modes by attenuators ( a ) . phases of states were controlled by electro - optical phase modulators ( pm ) . the principle of state discrimination lies in the interference of light beams at beam splitters . the discrimination is optimal when beam splitter bs@xmath9 is balanced , therefore a fiber coupler with fixed splitting ratio 50:50 was used . as beam splitters bs@xmath4 and bs@xmath6 we employed two variable - ratio couplers adjusted to desired splitting ratios . the whole setup including both the preparation of all coherent states and the identification of unknown state worked basically as two interconnected mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometers . to accomplish discriminating operation visibilities of both mz interferometers had to be maximized . this was provided by aligning polarizations and setting the same optical paths of arms corresponding to @xmath13 and @xmath1 and paths corresponding to @xmath15 and @xmath1 . before the measurement the path balance was roughly done by the help of two adjustable air - gaps and precisely by phase modulators during the measurement itself . changes of temperature and temperature gradients cause changes of refractive index of optical fibers and thereby the drift of phase in time . to reduce the phase - drift effect we utilized thermal isolation of the setup in a polystyren box . additionally an active stabilization was performed to compensate a residual phase drift . before each three - second measurement step phase deviations from the balanced state were monitored simultaneously in both mz interferometers and if necessary a proper correction was done by means of phase modulators @xcite . the signal was detected by four perkin - elmer single - photon counting avalanche photodiodes . two of them , d@xmath4 and d@xmath6 , served for both the discrimination and active stabilization while two others were used only for the stabilization . to minimize the influence of dark counts of detectors on a measurement we counted coincidences between signals from detectors d@xmath4 , d@xmath6 and pulses that triggered the laser diode . for this purposes coincidence electronics including time - to - amplitude convertors and single - channel analyzers were utilized . a coincidence window was set to the value of 8 ns . the mean number of dark counts in the coincidence window was approximately @xmath19 whereas the mean number of signal counts in the coincidence window in our experiment ranged from 0.002 to 0.7 . quantum efficiences of detectors also play an important role . they are essential for the measurement of amplitudes of coherent states and they constrain the succes probability of state identification . efficiencies were measured by means of a cw laser diode , a well - callibrated digital attenuator , and a power meter . first we determined the power of laser signal by the power meter . then the laser beam was attenuated by the digital attenuator and the count rates measured by the detector were compared with a photon flux calculated from the power measured beforehand . by this measurement we obtained efficiences of detectors @xmath20 .    in our experiment we tested the state identification for various combinations of states @xmath13 and @xmath15 . for each such measurement we first set desired intensities @xmath21 , @xmath22 of program states . then the intensity of state @xmath1 was adjusted to be equal either to the intensity of the first state or to the intensity of the second state . by applying proper voltages on phase modulators we were able to prepare coherent states with various phases . we measured conclusive count rates @xmath23 , when the state was correctly discriminated , and @xmath24 related to erroneous detections ; @xmath25 . for example when @xmath26 then @xmath27 . @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) were obtained by measuring coincidence rates between detector d@xmath6 ( d@xmath4 ) and trigger pulses of laser diode minus the coincidence rates between detectors d@xmath4 and d@xmath6 ( related to double clicks ) . @xmath30 and @xmath31 were measured in a similar way . the fractions of correct and erroneous results read @xmath32 respectively , where @xmath33 is the total number of laser pulses per measurement period . the fraction of conclusive results is thus @xmath34 ( j=1 ,  2 ) . experimental results are shown in figs . [ stejne]-[pmin ] . each measured point was averaged from data collected during ten three - second measurements . error bars correspond to statistical errors from these ten measuring steps . [ stejne ] and fig .  [ ruzne ] display the fraction of correct and erroneous results as a function of phase difference between coherent states @xmath13 and @xmath15 . the theoretical curves of probabilities of a conclusive result ( i.e.  probabilities of correct identification ) were calculated by equations ( [ p1 ] ) ,  ( [ p2 ] ) . in our case they are identical for the both program states due to the equality of the efficiencies of detectors d@xmath4 and d@xmath6 . measured data are presented as @xmath35 and @xmath36 according to equation ( [ p_meas ] ) . in the ideal case , when the visibility of interference is 100@xmath37 and there are no dark counts , the probability of a conclusive result is equal to the probability of correct identification . in our setup the effect of dark counts was minimized to be negligible and visibilities were around 98@xmath37 . the imperfect interference affects the quality of discrimination mainly in situations when the overlap of coherent states @xmath13 and @xmath15 is relatively high . [ pmin ] shows the probability of a conclusive result as a function of intensity ratio @xmath39 whereas the intensity of the first state was fixed to 1.33 photons per pulse . the upper line is related to situations when the overlap of states is for given intensities minimal ( phase difference 180@xmath38 between the states ) and the lower line corresponds to cases when the overlap is maximal ( phase difference 0@xmath38 between the states ) . implemented version of coherent state identification can be straightforwardly extended for more than two specimen states ( see fig . [ scheme_n ] ) . there is no experimental limitation for the extension of this scheme and even the stabilization of more than two mz interferometers can be performed simultaneously . however , the probability of correct identification decreases with increasing number of program states @xcite .    in summary , we have experimentally demonstated the unambiguous programmable discriminator of coherent states when the uknown state can equal to one of two different specimen states . measured values of fraction of correct results well agree with the theoretical predictions . our experimental setup represents a technically feasible way to implement some interesting quantum information tasks , e.g. quantum database search @xcite or an attack on quantum key distribution @xcite . m.d . acknowledges fruitful discussions with michal sedlk , mrio ziman , ondej pibyla , jaromr fiurek , and radim filip . this research was supported by the projects lc06007 , 1m06002 and msm6198959213 of the ministry of education of the czech republic and by the secoqc project of the ec ( ist-2002 - 506813 ) .

nucleus collisions @xcite has led to a series of investigations of @xmath0 production based on this approach @xcite . initial interest focussed on the available sps data for @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions , but the trends for rhic and lhc were also investigated . an independent approach , based on a kinetic model @xcite has been developed in parallel . recently the statistical hadronization model was extended to the production of @xmath1 mesons @xcite and multiply heavy - flavored hadrons @xcite . we have shown earlier @xcite that the @xmath0 data at sps energy can be described within the statistical approach , but only when assuming that the charm production cross section is enhanced by about a factor of 3 beyond the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) predictions . for rhic energy , the predictions of our model were shown @xcite to be in good agreement with the early phenix @xmath0 data @xcite as well as with the relative yields of open charm mesons measured by star @xcite . we focus in this paper on the production of charmonia in nucleus - nucleus collisions at rhic ( au - au , @xmath2=200 gev ) and lhc ( pb - pb , @xmath2=5.5 tev ) energies within the framework of the statistical hadronization model , shm @xcite . particular emphasis is placed on the rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of @xmath0 and , for lhc energy , also @xmath1 production . section 2 contains a brief summary of the main ingredients of the model along with a description of recent updates concerning the chemical freeze - out parameters , the spectrum of open charm mesons and baryons , and the values of charm production cross section . furthermore , for a more realistic description of the centrality dependence in nucleus - nucleus collisions , we separate the collision geometry into a core and a corona part .    in section 3 , we provide an estimate of the magnitude of @xmath3 annihilation in the expanding quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) . in section 4 , we use the model to predict phase space distributions of quarkonia produced in nucleus - nucleus collisions . we compare the results with sps data and with data available at rhic @xcite and provide predictions for the lhc energy , where data @xcite are expected in about two years . in particular the situation at sps energy is significantly modified when taking into account the realistic reaction geometry . we extend the model for the calculation of @xmath1 yields in pb+pb collisions at lhc energy . in this case , despite the similarity in production rates of bottom at lhc with charm at rhic @xcite , the applicability of our model may be questionable , as the thermalization of the bottom quarks may be debatable . we discuss below the main sources of uncertainty in these calculations . the statistical hadronization model ( shm ) @xcite assumes that all heavy quarks ( charm and bottom ) are produced in primary hard collisions and that their total number stays constant until hadronization . the validity of this latter point is investigated in the next section . another important factor is thermal ( but not chemical ) equilibration in the qgp , at least near the critical temperature , @xmath4 . the quarkonia are then all produced ( non - perturbatively ) when @xmath4 is reached and the system hadronizes . our picture is different from the one of color screening @xcite ( see @xcite for a more recent account ) , which assumes that formation of quarkonia takes place before a thermalized qgp is established but is suppressed in the qgp when the temperature reaches a certain threshold , which is species dependent . recent results from solving quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) on the lattice indicate indeed that @xmath0 mesons could survive in the qgp up to 1.6@xmath4 @xcite , implying , e.g. little melting at sps energies . further investigations indicate that @xmath1 mesons may survive up to temperatures of at least 2.3@xmath4 @xcite .    in the shm , we assume that ( i ) no quarkonia production takes place before the formation time @xmath5 of the qgp or ( ii ) that all quarkonia formed before @xmath5 are melted in the initial hot qgp phase . under this scenario the possible existence of bound quarkonia states in the qgp is not important , since the estimates made in the next section demonstrate that , unless there is a resonance - like enhancement of the cross section , formation of quarkonia from uncorrelated @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks in the expanding plasma is very unlikely even if such states exist as bound states . thermal equilibration of charm quarks in a qgp1 gev ) temperatures , as is demonstrated in @xcite . ] is currently investigated vigorously both experimentally and theoretically . in particular , elliptic flow of charm quarks @xcite has been demonstrated within a coalescence approach @xcite to be a very sensitive probe of thermalization . large elliptic flow is obtained in hydrodynamic simulations based on the diffusion coefficient of charm quarks in a qgp @xcite . elliptic flow of @xmath0 is smaller in recent hydrodynamic calculations @xcite than in coalescence models @xcite . remarkably , the experimental results on the elliptic flow of electrons from charm mesons ( `` non - photonic '' electrons ) @xcite do indicate that charm quarks indeed thermalize to a significant degree . in addition , a large energy loss of charm quarks in the qgp @xcite has been recently found by experiments @xcite . the experimental results of phenix @xcite indicate in fact a larger energy loss than theoretically expected @xcite . the mechanism for charm thermalization is not well understood . a model based on resonant rescattering of heavy quarks in the qgp @xcite reproduces quite well the experimental results . it is worth noticing that in this model the thermalization time for heavy quarks is substantially reduced compared to the case of perturbative interactions @xcite . in transport models the measured elliptic flow can be reproduced only for a charm quark scattering cross section that is much larger than the cross sections computed within perturbative qcd @xcite . in any case , we note that the shm can be applied even if charm thermalization is reached only close to @xmath4 .    in the following we briefly outline the calculation steps in our model @xcite . the heavy quark ( charm or bottom ) balance equation @xcite , which has to include canonical suppression factors whenever the number of charm or bottom pairs is not much larger than 1 , is used to determine a fugacity factor @xmath8 via : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the number of directly produced @xmath3 pairs and @xmath11 are modified bessel functions . in the fireball of volume @xmath12 the total number of open ( @xmath13 ) and hidden ( @xmath14 ) charm hadrons is computed from their grand - canonical densities @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively . the densities of different particle species in the grand canonical ensemble are calculated following the statistical model @xcite . the balance equation ( [ aa : eq1 ] ) defines the fugacity parameter @xmath8 that accounts for deviations of heavy quark multiplicity from the value that is expected in complete chemical equilibrium . since in the shm the charm and bottom quark yields are completey determined by their production in initial ( hard ) collisions the fugacity factor can be very large , especially for bottom production . the yield of charmonia of type @xmath17 is obtained as : @xmath18 . [ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     in fig . [ aa_fig7x ] we present predictions for the transverse momentum spectrum of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in central collisions at lhc . we show the spectra for a range of expansion velocities , as expected for lhc energy . for pp collisions in the corona we have assumed the same spectral shape at lhc as measured in p@xmath19 collisions at tevatron @xcite , which are also included for comparison in fig . [ aa_fig7x ] . the corona fractions corresponding to central pb+pb collisions ( @xmath20=350 ) are 0.13 for @xmath0 and 0.09 for @xmath1 . for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the spectral shapes expected within the statistical hadronization model are very different compared those expected from the superposition of pp collisions , making the data at lhc a stringent test of our model . we have presented new results on the statistical hadronization of heavy quarks at the sps , rhic and lhc energies . we have focused on the results for @xmath0 yields , but have also extended the model to predict @xmath1 yields in pb+pb collisions at the lhc energy . included in our model is now a separation of the collision geometry into a core ( qgp ) and a corona ( pp collisions ) part . our estimate of the annihilation rates of charm quark in a hot plasma demonstrates that this is a small effect . an important ingredient in our model is the charm production cross section , which is presently quite poorly measured . we have considered the effect of its uncertainty on the model predictions . for sps energy , our present calculations are performed assuming that the hadronization takes place within one unit of rapidity at midrapidity , as used also for rhic and lhc energies . good agreement with data is found with a charm cross section which is moderately ( a factor of 2 ) larger , but consistent within errors with pqcd calculations . for rhic energy we have studied the centrality and rapidity dependence of @xmath0 production . our model is in good agreement with the available data , lending strong support for the picture of statistical hadronization . we have discussed the transverse momentum distributions of @xmath0 mesons expected from the model . the present data , in particular those at rhic energy , are compatible with the picture of the @xmath0 ( kinematic ) freeze - out coincident with chemical freeze - out , but more precise data are needed to quantitatively explore this idea . our predictions for lhc energy concerning centrality , rapidity and transverse momentum dependence of the @xmath0 yield will be tested with data within the next few years . we are indebted to m. cacciari for providing us the rapidity distribution of the charm production cross section at the rhic energy and for valuable discussions . p. braun - munzinger , j. stachel , [ nucl - th/0007059 ] ; [ nucl - th/0012064 ] . gorenstein , a.p . kostyuk , h. stcker , w. greiner , [ hep - ph/0010148 ] ; [ hep - ph/0104071 ] l. grandchamp , r. rapp , [ hep - ph/0103124 ] ; [ hep - ph/0205305 ] . kostyuk , m.i . gorenstein , h. stcker , w. greiner , [ hep - ph/0110269 ] ; [ hep - ph/0305277 ] . a. andronic , p. braun - munzinger , k. redlich , j. stachel , phys . b 571 ( 2003 ) 36 [ nucl - th/0303036 ] . e.l . bratkovskaya , a.p . kostyuk , w. cassing , h. stcker , phys . c 69 ( 2004 ) 054903 [ nucl - th/0402042 ] . r. vogt , int . e 12 ( 2003 ) 211 [ hep - ph/0111271 ] . m. cacciari , p. nason , r. vogt , phys . 95 ( 2005 ) 122001 [ hep - ph/0502203 ] . m. cacciari , private communication . alice collaboration , j. phys . g : nucl . part .

( [ unit ] ) involves two - body but also many - body terms . similarly , if a one - body current is introduced in one representation , the other one contains two , ... body currents to ensure the unitary equivalence . the role of the two - body part is examined in the following section . applications involve the interaction models : nij2@xcite , argonne v18@xcite , reid93@xcite which are local ones , nij1@xcite , nij93@xcite , paris@xcite which have a linearly @xmath4 dependence , and the bonn - qb , bonn - cd ones@xcite . concerning static properties , a quantity of interest is the deuteron d - state probability , often referred to characterize different models . the difference between the paris and bonn - qb model is 0.78% . as the two models have quite close values for the mixing parameters , @xmath25 , their comparison is largely free of bias with this respect . taking into account the effect of the non - local term , @xmath26 , explains 0.74% ( 0.60% and 0.14% for the commutator and anti - commutator parts respectively ) . notice that the change in the deuteron d - state probability just reflects the fact that this quantity is not an observable one . similar results were reached by von geramb et al.@xcite , using the inverse scattering problem methods . another interesting quantity is the ratio @xmath27 , which , contrary to the above one , is observable . the difference is 0.23 @xmath28 while @xmath26 explains 0.20 @xmath28 . it is also instructive to look at quantities that only depend on the scalar anticommutator part of @xmath26 . in this order , we compare the squared charge radius for the models nij1 and nij2 . the models differ by an amount of 0.004 @xmath29 while the effect of the non - locality is estimated to be around 0.001 @xmath29 . the apparent failure to explain the discrepancy in this case actually points to the difference of the models for the asymptotic normalization @xmath2 , which as is well known , governs the size of the charge radius . this factor is not affected by the present analysis of non - local effects .    ratios of form factors and related quantities calculated in different representations of the interaction should go to 1 when the non - locality effect is accounted for and provided that the unitary equivalence is ensured . it is not so in practice because the unitary transformation is treated at first order . in each case , there are thus two sets of results , depending on whether corrections are added to predictions made with one model or removed from the other ones .    ratios of predictions made from the bonn - qb and paris models for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 observables are shown in fig . as it can be seen , the ratio of bare predictions ( continuous line ) tends to 1 when the effect of the anticommutator ( dashed and dotted lines ) and commutator terms ( small - dash and dashed - dotted lines ) is considered . a large part of the effect is due to the tensor part of @xmath26 . notice that a slight departure from 1 appears for @xmath1 around @xmath30 . the effect of the scalar part of the anticommutator , which is seen in fig . [ fig2 ] ( left part ) , shows features similar to the previous ones . it involves the s - wave function close to the origin , which is generally suppressed in local models compared to non - local ones . the right part of the same figure emphasizes a case where an agreement between two models turns into a disagreement . in fact , this one is consistent with what is expected from the comparison of the asymptotic normalization , unaffected by the present analysis . in fig . [ fig3 ] , all predictions corrected for the effect of a non - local term are compared to the paris ones . at low @xmath31 , it is seen that some discrepancy is still present while the initial motivation of the work was rather to explain it by non - locality effects . actually , for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the discrepancy reflects a sensitivity to the @xmath32 ratio in the first case and @xmath2 in the second one . around @xmath33 , the ratio becomes very close to 1 , while in absence of corrections departures up to 10% and 20% respectively could be observed . the decrease of the uncertainty has motivated schiavella and sick in using the quadrupole form factor to derive the neutron charge form factor@xcite . effects of non - local terms in nn interaction models have been considered . roughly , they explain a large part of the differences that the comparison of various model predictions for electromagnetic observables evidences . the part with a tensor character has been found to be the dominant one . it is also the best determined . similar conclusions hold in some cases for the scalar part but the effect is often masked by other effects related to the fact that models correspond to different values of the asymptotic normalization , @xmath2 , which is an observable and remains unchanged in the analysis performed here .    while the original goal of present studies was rather to relate discrepancies between models to some non - locality , it appears that this is not always possible , especially at low @xmath31 . interestingly however , accounting for this effect tends to restore some hierarchy of the results , as expected from simple models . thus , in the above range , the structure function , @xmath0 , and the quadrupole form factor , @xmath34 , evidence a direct sensitivity respectively to the asymptotic normalizations , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which are unaffected by the present analysis of non - local effects . the result of the analysis presented here was not a priori guaranteed . the fact that it points to a unique family of phase - equivalent models indicates that the sensitivty of the models to different parametrizations of the radial part for instance or to a different fit to experimental data is rather small . thus , the availability of various models is not without interest . the remaining sensitivity , as for @xmath2 or equivalently the scattering length , @xmath35 , strongly calls for a more accurate determination of these quantities . throughout the present study , we compare together predictions of models for electromagnetic observables . ultimately , a comparison to experiment should be done . in this respect , a model to be prefered , most probably non - local , is that one based on degrees of freedom of which effectice character , unavoidable in any case , is as low as possible .    9 p. doleschall and i. borbly : phys . rev . * c62 * , 054004 ( 2000 ) . m. lacombe et al . : phys . rev . * c21 * , 861 ( 1980 ) . r. machleidt , k. holinde and ch . elster : phys . rep . * 149 * , 1 ( 1987 ) ; r. machleidt : adv . in nucl . phys . * 19 * , 189 ( 1989 ) ; r. machleidt : phys . rev . * c63 * , 024001 ( 2001 ) . v. kukulin ( plenary talk , this conference ) . stoks et al . : phys . rev . * c49 * , 2950 ( 1994 ) . b. desplanques and a. amghar : z. phys . * 344 * , 19 ( 1992 ) . a. amghar and b. desplanques : nucl . * a585 * , 657 ( 1995 ) . a. amghar and b. desplanques : nucl - th/0209058 . j. forest : phys . rev . * c61 * , 034007 ( 2000 ) . friar : phys . * c22 * , 796 ( 1980 ) . wiringa , v.g.j . stoks and r. schiavella : phys . rev . * c51 * , 38 ( 1995 ) . von geramb , lectures notes in physics : vol . * 427 * , ( 1994 ) ; b.f . gibson , h. kohlhoff and h.v . von geramb : phys . rev . * c51 * , r465 ( 1995 ) . r. schiavella and i. sick : phys . rev . * c64 * , 041002(r ) ( 2001 ) .

@xmath8 @xcite . deviations from the sm predictions for tngbcs and qngbcs might point to new interactions such as those arising from strongly - interacting electroweak models @xcite , a fourth family of chiral fermions with sm assignments of quantum numbers @xcite , and the heavy fermions arising in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite . an interesting feature of qngbcs involving at least one photon field stems from the fact that they are genuine in the sense that arise from effective operators that do not induce any trilinear gauge boson coupling . therefore these genuine qngbcs must be constrained from processes other than the ones used to constrain trilinear gauge boson couplings , such as boson - pair fusion or triple - boson production @xcite . this is to be contrasted with the case of the quartic @xmath9 coupling , which can arise from operators that also induce the trilinear @xmath10 coupling , which means that any constraint on the latter can be immediately translated into a bound on the former . furthermore , while the quartic neutral @xmath11 coupling can be induced at tree - level , for instance by the exchange of a heavy scalar boson , qngbcs involving at least one photon field can only arise at one - loop level or higher order in any renormalizable theory because of electromagnetic gauge invariance . in particular , qngbcs have been constrained from the cern @xmath12 collider lep-2 data on triple gauge boson production @xcite . considerable work has also been devoted to the analysis of qngbcs through different processes at the next linear @xmath12 collider as well as @xmath13 , @xmath14 and hadron colliders @xcite .    in this note we will present a detailed calculation of the @xmath1 coupling contribution to the rare decay @xmath15 . the current experimental limit on this decay mode @xcite will then be used to constrain the coefficients of this qngbc . to our knowledge , this calculation has never been presented in the literature . our analysis will proceed in the same line as those presented in our previous works @xcite , where we obtained bounds on tngbcs from the @xmath16 decay mode @xcite and on neutrino - photon interactions from @xmath17 @xcite . we will find that the bounds obtained in this way rely on very few assumptions , though they are weaker than the ones obtained from the analysis of @xmath18 and @xmath19 data at lep-2 @xcite . the organization of the paper is as follows . in section ii we present a short description of the effective lagrangian for the @xmath1 coupling . section iii is devoted to present the calculation of the rare decay @xmath0 . finally , our conclusions are presented in section iv . when parametrizing physics beyond the fermi scale in a model - independent manner by means of the effective lagrangian technique there are two alternatives , i.e. the underlying new physics can be assumed to be either of decoupled or nondecoupled nature @xcite . in the decoupling scenario it is assumed that the higgs mechanism is realized in nature , thereby requiring the existence of at least one ( relatively ) light higgs boson . in this case the low - energy theory is renormalizable _  la _ dyson , the decoupling theorem remains valid , and the effective lagrangian is constructed out of operators respecting the @xmath20 symmetry linearly . in this scenario the virtual heavy physics effects can not affect dramatically the low - energy processes : the impact of new physics might become important only in those processes that are absent or very suppressed within the sm @xcite . on the other hand , another possibility ( the nondecoupling scenario ) arises if the higgs boson is very heavy or does not exist at all . there follows that the low - energy theory is nonrenormalizable due to the absence of the higgs boson . this class of new physics can be assumed to be responsible for the symmetry breaking of the electroweak sector . in this scenario the @xmath21 symmetry is nonlinearly realized@xcite . the lowest - dimension operators that induce the @xmath22 coupling have dimension six ( eight ) in the nonlinear ( linear ) realization . this means that any new physics effects arising from this coupling are likely to become more evident in the nonlinear scenario since in the linear one they are suppressed by higher powers of the new physics scale @xmath23 . therefore , in this work we will concentrate on the nonlinear scenario . furthermore , only those operators that respect the custodial @xmath24 and the discrete @xmath25 and @xmath26 symmetries will be considered . it turns out that the operators that violate the custodial symmetry are tightly constrained by the @xmath27 parameter . in the nonlinear scenario there are fourteen dimension - six operators that induce the @xmath22 coupling at tree level @xcite . this was discussed to a large extent in ref . @xcite and we will not dwell on this issue here . we rather focus on the lorentz structure induced for the @xmath1 coupling . in the unitarity gauge ( @xmath28 ) , there are only two independent lorentz structures for this coupling induced by dimension - six operators @xcite :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 and @xmath31 . we have followed closely the notation introduced in @xcite . below we will proceed to compute the decay @xmath32 using the above effective interaction . the experimental limit on this decay will then be used to constrain the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 . we now turn to outline the calculation of the decay width for @xmath35 , which is somewhat similar to the one presented in ref . @xcite for the rare decay @xmath36 in two higgs doublet models , with @xmath37 the @xmath38-odd neutral scalar . in ref . @xcite , the experimental bound on the rare @xmath35 decay was used to constrain the neutrino - photon interactions @xmath39 and @xmath40 . here we will make an analysis along the same lines but focus on the purely bosonic @xmath1 coupling , which contributes to the @xmath41 decay through the feynman diagram shown in fig . [ znngg ] . contribution from the effective @xmath1 coupling to the rare @xmath42 decay.,width=240 ]    the 4-vectors of the participating particles will be denoted as follows @xmath43 . the feynman rule for the effective vertex @xmath44 is straightforwardly obtained from eq . ( [ eflag ] ) :    @xmath45\\bigg\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where all the momenta are directed inward . the decay width can then be written as    @xmath46    with @xmath47 and @xmath48 for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . by the usual method and after a lengthy calculation we can obtain the squared amplitude . it reads    @xmath51    where we have introduced the definition    @xmath52    with @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in eq . ( [ mcuad ] ) a factor of 3 is included in the denominator as we are averaging over the @xmath55 boson polarizations ; also , a factor of 2 has been introduced to account for two identical particles in the final state . the integration over @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be carried out straightforwardly with the aid of the following result @xcite    @xmath58    where @xmath59 . once we are done with the integration over @xmath56 and @xmath57 , there still remains to integrate over @xmath60 and @xmath48 . to this end we will work in the center of mass frame of the @xmath55 boson . we find it useful to define the following variables @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 . the decay width can thus be expressed as    @xmath64    where    @xmath65    and    @xmath66    it can be shown that the integration region @xmath67 is given by @xcite    @xmath68    together with @xmath69 . after numerical integration we are left with    @xmath70    with @xmath71 and @xmath72 . in addition , if lepton universality is assumed , eq . ( [ result ] ) is to be multiplied by 3 to account for all of the known neutrino species . from the lep-2 data , the l3 collaboration set the following limit on @xmath0 @xcite    @xmath73    assuming that either @xmath74 or @xmath75 is dominant we obtain the following bounds    @xmath76    which are weaker than those obtained at lep-2 from @xmath77 and @xmath78 production @xcite . however , it is important to note that the bounds based on the latter processes do not agree , as pointed out in ref . @xcite , which means that much work along these lines is still required . in general eqs . ( [ result ] ) and ( [ expbound ] ) yield an allowed area in the @xmath33 versus @xmath34 plane , as depicted in fig . [ area ] . allowed area ( gray region ) in the @xmath33 vs. @xmath34 plane from the experimental bound on the @xmath79 rare decay.,width=240 ]    we can also take a different approach and instead of bounding the @xmath1 coupling , we may use the most stringent bounds on it to predict its contribution to the @xmath0 decay . from the most stringent experimental bound on the @xmath33 and @xmath34 coefficients , of the order of @xmath80-@xmath81 @xcite , it follows a limit on the contribution of the @xmath1 coupling to the @xmath0 decay :    @xmath82    this indirect bound is above than the one found for the contribution of the neutrino - one - photon interaction @xmath39 , which is of the order of @xmath83 @xcite . in closing it is interesting to note that the @xmath1 coupling also contributes to the rare decay @xmath84 , for which an experimental bound has already been set @xcite . this rare decay mode also receives contributions from the quartic @xmath85 coupling . therefore it would be possible , in principle , to use this rare decay to bound such qngbcs . as far as the @xmath85 coupling is concerned , a tighter bound on it can be obtained from the three - body decay @xmath86 . the latter , together with the @xmath87 reaction , have been studied within the effective lagrangian approach @xcite and we will not repeat the same analysis here . from the result presented in ref . @xcite a bound on the effective @xmath85 vertex can be derived , which is of the same order of magnitude of the one obtained in this work for the @xmath1 coupling . finally we would like to emphasize that the importance of studying qngbcs is rooted in the fact that they have a different origin than tngbcs , i.e. they are induced by effective operators that do not induce any tngbc . in this work we have found a constraint on the @xmath1 coupling from the @xmath88 decay mode , which is weaker than the bounds derived from the analysis of @xmath77 and @xmath78 production at lep-2 . this is explained from the fact that the decay @xmath89 has a suppression factor due to the virtual @xmath55 boson propagator , which suffers less suppression when the initial @xmath55 boson is allowed to be off - shell . m. acciarri _ et al . _ , b 478 , 39 ( 2000 ) ; 490 , 187 ( 2000 ) ; p. achard _ et al . _ , b 540 , 43 ( 2002 ) ; 527 , 293 ( 2002 ) ; g. abbiendi _ et al . _ , b 471 , 293 ( 1999 ) ; w. j. stirling and a. werthenbach , phys . lett 466 , 369 ( 1999 ) ; eur.phys.j.c 14 , 103 ( 2000 ) . eboli and j.k . mizukoshi , phys . rev . d 64 , 075011 ( 2001 ) ; o.j.p . eboli , m.c . gonzalez - garca , s.m . lietti , and s.f . novaes , phys . rev . d 63 , 075008 ( 2001 ) ; o.j.p . eboli , m.c . gonzalez - garca , and j.k . mizukoshi phys . rev . d 58 , 034008 ( 1998 ) ; o.j.p . eboli , m.b . magro , p.g . mercadante , and s.f . novaes , phys . rev . d 52 , 15 ( 1995 ) ; a. denner , s. dittmaier , m. roth , and d. wackeroth , eur . phys . j. c 20 , 201 ( 2001 ) .

@xcite ) . although the link between the lmxbs and msps is strong , evidence that lmxbs did indeed contain objects spinning at millisecond periods was , until recently , still missing . the quasi - periodic oscillations , especially near 1khz ( @xcite ) , recently discovered in x - ray binary systems offer indirect evidence for the existence of weakly magnetized neutron stars with millisecond periods . however , the recent discovery of 2.49  ms coherent x - ray pulsations from the lmxb sax  j1808.43658 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) now gives strong support to the picture that lmxbs are the progenitors of msps ; this system provides the best evidence yet that a low - field neutron star can be spun up to millisecond periods via accretion from its companion . there are a number of processes which could potentially produce radio emission from such a system . an exciting possibility is that will , at some point , turn on as a radio pulsar , producing pulsed radio emission characteristic of msps . timing of such pulses could allow an improved determination of the astrometric , rotational and orbital parameters of the system as well as the determination of possible post - keplerian and tidal effects . furthermore they could probe any wind produced by the interaction between the pulsar and its companion such as in the eclipsing binary millisecond pulsar systems ( e.g. @xcite ) . such emission could potentially be heavily scattered by this interaction or by interactions with material excreted from the system ( e.g. @xcite ) . thus it would appear unpulsed and could only be detected as a continuum source . alternatively , unpulsed radio emission could be produced by the interaction of the relativistic pulsar wind with the interstellar medium ( e.g. @xcite ) . finally , radio emission could be associated with the accretion process and x - ray outburst , as seen in a significant fraction of the x - ray binary population ( @xcite ;

flux densities are given in table  2 . the source was not detected at 1.4 ghz . we attemped various approaches to the imaging , deconvolution and fitting processes . the results of these suggest a systematic uncertainty in the flux densities for the source of @xmath050% , a value to be expected when deconvolving a weak source under conditions of poor @xmath14 coverage . our best position for this source is ra ( j2000 ) @xmath15 , dec ( j2000 ) @xmath16 with an uncertainty of @xmath17 in each coordinate . in the bottom panel of figure  [ fig_contours ] , our position and the optically determined positions of giles et al . ( 1999 ) and roche et al . ( 1998 ) are compared . all three positions are consistent within the quoted uncertainties . the source shown in figure  [ fig_contours ] is almost certainly not an artifact . it is not at the phase center , and was detected at three different frequencies and for a variety of different weighting schemes and combinations of baselines . while the probability of finding an unrelated radio source within a few arcsec of sax  j1808.43658  is low in any case , we note that this source was not detected at any other epoch , despite the improved sensitivity of these later observations . furthermore , the region was observed with the very large array ( vla ) on 1998 apr 26 , the day immediately before obs  1 , and no source was detected at this position down to a comparable sensitivity ( r.m . hjellming , private communication ) . therefore , from its transient nature and positional coincidence with the optical counterpart of sax  j1808.43658 , we conclude that this radio source is associated with the system . our data lack the time - resolution required to search for pulsed radio emission from this source . however , x - ray emission due to accretion was present at the time of our detection , and it is likely that if any radio emission was being produced in the pulsar magnetosphere it would be quenched by this process . thus the source we have detected is most likely not emission associated with the magnetosphere . it is also unlikely that the source corresponds to emission from a pulsar wind ( if such a wind even exists at this point in the system s evolution )  if we assume that the disappearance of the source between obs 1 and obs 2 is due to synchrotron losses , then this cooling time - scale implies a magnetic field in the wind of @xmath182  g , many orders of magnitudes higher than observed for other pulsars ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) . the detection of radio emission only at an epoch during which x - rays were still being generated provides strong evidence that this radio source is related to the accretion process . radio emission has been detected from @xmath025% of all x - ray binaries ( @xcite ) . in cases for which this emission has been resolved , it takes the form of jets being emitted from the system , often at relativistic velocities ( @xcite ) . the burst properties and rapid x - ray variability of sax  j1808.43658 suggest that it is an atoll source , i.e.  a low magnetic field neutron star accreting at about 10% of the eddington limit ( @xcite ) . fender & hendry ( 1999 ) review the radio properties of different types of persistent x - ray binaries , and show that most atoll sources show no radio emission  the only detections have been transient , and at the mjy level . when transient radio emission is seen from the atoll sources , the spectrum is first seen absorbed , but then becomes optically thin and takes on a synchrotron spectrum with @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) . the emission then decays away through adiabatic losses ( e.g. @xcite ) . the properties of the radio emission seen here for sax j1808.43658 are consistent with this behavior . while the spectrum of the source is very poorly constrained by our data , the flux densities for it at 2.5  ghz and above are consistent with @xmath19 , while the non - detection at 1.4  ghz is suggestive of a low - frequency turnover probably due to self - absorption in the ejecta . we note that on 1998 apr 26 , the day before our radio detection , the x - ray flux suddenly deviated from exponential decay and began to rapidly decrease ( @xcite ) . as discussed by these authors , there are two different mechanisms which can produce such a cut - off , either the onset of the so - called `` propeller phase '' or an instability of the accretion disk . in both cases the abrupt change corresponds to ejection of material from the system . the appearance of transient radio emission just after this event suggests that it is this ejection of material which has produced the source we see here . if we assume that emission above 2.5  ghz corresponds to optically thin , incoherent , unbeamed , synchrotron emission , the @xmath21  k compton limit on the brightness temperature corresponds to a minimum scale for the emission of @xmath012  light  seconds at a distance of 4  kpc , much larger than the @xmath01  light second binary separation of the orbit ( @xcite ) . thus the emission is coming from well beyond the binary , as would be expected if it has resulted from an expulsion of material from the system .    at later times , no radio emission was detected at the position of sax  j1808.43658 . this is not necessarily indicative that the radio pulse mechanism is not yet functioning . despite strong limits on the flux density from our non - detections , the apparently large distance to the system of @xmath04kpc corresponds to a 3@xmath22 monochromatic luminosity limit of @xmath23  mjy  kpc@xmath2 , greater than that of the majority of known msps ( @xcite ) . furthermore , ergma et al . ( 1999 ) have proposed that this system may only be detected at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath24 cm ) due to free - free absorption by material excreted from the system . we have detected a transient radio source coincident with sax  j1808.43658 ; the source turned on within a day , and then had disappeared again a month later . we interpret this source as radio emission associated with ejection of material , as seen in other x - ray binaries , and in this case possibly associated with the onset of a propellor phase or a disk instability the day before the source was detected . the spectrum and light curve of this source are essentially unconstrained , however , and the source should certainly be searched for radio emission next time it is in outburst . eventually , it is hoped that this source will emerge as a radio msp ; radio searches in quiescence should continue to be carried out in anticipation of this . we thank rob fender and deepto chakrabarty for useful discussions , bob hjellming for communicating the results of his vla observations , and scott cunningham , lucyna kedziora - chudczer , robin wark and mark wieringa for assistance with the observations . the australia telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by csiro . bmg acknowledges the support of nasa through hubble fellowship grant hf-01107.01 - 98a awarded by the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc . , for nasa under contract nas 526555 . bws is supported by nwo spinoza grant 08 - 0 to e.p.j . van den heuvel .

distance soliton - based fibre transmission meets with difficulties imposed by random jitter in the soliton arrival time caused by the spontaneous amplifier noise ( the so - called gordon - haus effect  @xcite).the amplifier noise incorporated by the soliton produces a random soliton frequency shift which leads to a timing shift because of the group velocity dispersion . the gordon -

averaged dispersion  @xcite .    from the viewpoint of the inverse scattering transform , the theory of the gordon - haus effect is a direct consequence of the adiabatic soliton perturbation theory for the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation , with perturbation being the amplifier noise  @xcite . the nls equation serves as the integrable model describing the picosecond soliton dynamics in fibres . on the other hand , when dealing with ultrashort optical pulses with duration @xmath0 100 fs , the nls equation should be modified to adopt more subtle effects , such as the nonlinearity dispersion , the raman self - frequency shift and the third - order dispersion  @xcite . it is remarkable that the account for the nonlinearity dispersion does not break the integrability of the equation . in other words , the modified nls ( mnls ) equation    @xmath1    is still integrable by means of the inverse scattering transform  @xcite , though the linear spectral problem associated with the mnls equation differs from that for the nls equation ( with @xmath2 ) . here @xmath3 is the normalized slowly varying amplitude of the electric field envelope , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the normalized propagation distance and time in the frame comoving with the group velocity , the real parameter @xmath6 governs the effect of the nonlinearity dispersion . we consider the mnls equation  ( [ 1 ] ) as the integrable model for ultrashort optical pulses , i.e. , playing the same role as the nls equation does for picosecond solitons . thereby , we change the status of the nonlinearity dispersion term from being a perturbation in the nls equation to the essential ingredient of the mnls equation . it is important that such a change is in no way an issue of our convenience . it was shown by ohkuma _ et al . _ @xcite that numerical simulation of soliton propagation revealed a number of features which can not be accounted for by treating this term as a perturbation term in the nls equation . in the recent paper @xcite , the adiabatic perturbation theory for mnls solitons was elaborated . so , a question to analyze the gordon -

haus effect for the mnls solitons , as distinct from the nls solitons , can be suppressed by properly adjusting the soliton / fibre parameters , without making use of external means . in the end of the paper we briefly discuss the suitability of this result to actual femtosecond solitons . we consider the perturbed mnls equation    @xmath7    where @xmath8 stands for spontaneous amplifier noise . in order to digress the details of minor importance , we consider distributed gain that exactly compensates for the fibre loss . further , we consider the amplifier bandwidth to be much larger than the soliton bandwidth . because erbium - doped amplifiers have a gain bandwidth of the order of 40 nm  @xcite , this assumption works well for the ultrashort pulses . we consider the noise @xmath8 as the delta - correlated function both in time and space , @xmath9 the estimation of the coefficient @xmath10 can be found in  @xcite . finally , we treat the noise @xmath8 as being small to justify the perturbative approach . the unperturbed soliton of the mnls equation  ( [ 1 ] ) was derived as early as in 1983 by gerdjikov and ivanov  @xcite . we will use more simple and transparent expression  @xcite for the soliton solution of  ( [ 1 ] ) : @xmath11 here @xmath12 and @xmath13 are linearly expressed through coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 : @xmath14 parameters @xmath15 and @xmath16 determine initial position and initial phase of the soliton , the complex parameter @xmath17 , @xmath18 determines velocity ( more exactly , shift of the reciprocal soliton velocity ) @xmath19 and width @xmath20 of the soliton,@xmath21 where the @xmath4-dependence of the soliton velocity and width arises from the perturbation - induced @xmath4-dependence of the parameter @xmath22 ( see below  ( [ 8 ] ) ) . functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the direct analogs of the gordon s position and phase parameters for the nls soliton  @xcite . the soliton  ( [ 4 ] ) has a number of peculiarities which distinguish it from the nls soliton  @xcite . for example , the important invariant of eq . ( [ 1 ] ) , namely , the optical energy@xmath25 has the upper limit @xmath26 . it should be stressed that @xmath6 enters the denominator of the soliton solution  ( [ 4 ] ) ( because of @xmath20 ) , so we account non - perturbatively for the nonlinearity dispersion . in other words , the parameter @xmath6 does not to be small in general . nevertheless , a non - trivial limiting procedure exists  @xcite permitting to restore from  ( [ 4 ] ) the nls soliton as @xmath27 . indeed , let us take the limit @xmath28 then it is easy to see that the soliton velocity and width  ( [ 6 ] ) transform in the limit  ( [ 7 ] ) as @xmath29 , @xmath30 , i. e. , to the nls parameters , while the mnls soliton  ( [ 4 ] ) produces exactly the nls soliton @xmath31 with @xmath32 , @xmath33 . as it was shown in  @xcite , a perturbation - induced z - evolution of the parameter @xmath22 is given by the simple formula:@xmath34 .\\label{8}\\ ] ] which is transformed in accordance with  ( [ 6 ] ) into the corresponding relations for velocity and width:@xmath35\\equiv s_{v}(z),\\ ] ] @xmath36\\equiv s_{w}(z ) .\\ ] ] here @xmath37 and @xmath38 stand for the noise sources driving velocity and width . because noise @xmath8 is given in terms of the correlation function  ( [ 3 ] ) , the responses are also expressed in the same form . we are mostly interested in the mean - square fluctuation @xmath39  ( @xmath40 being a fibre length ) of the soliton displacement @xmath23  ( [ 5 ] ) which is given in the presence of perturbation by @xmath41 with @xmath19 and @xmath42 determined from  ( [ 9 ] ) . the jitter of the soliton displacement in the comoving frame is calculated from @xmath43 where z - evolution of @xmath15 is given by @xcite@xmath44 @xmath45[s(x)e^{-i\\psi}-\\bar{s}(-x)e^{i\\psi } ] . \\noindent\\ ] ] since the soliton velocity and width enter eq .

( remind that distributed gain compensates exactly for fiber losses ) . besides , we express the soliton width @xmath20 in terms of @xmath19 and @xmath61 due to the relation @xmath62 finally , we obtain from  ( [ 14 ] ) and  ( [ 13 ] ) the correlation function for the soliton displacement driven by fluctuations of the velocity - to - width ratio:@xmath63 similar calculation for the @xmath52-driven correlation @xmath64 in accordance with  ( [ 11 ] ) displays the linear growth with @xmath40 . hence , for large propagation distances the correlation function  ( [ 18 ] ) provides the main contribution to the total mean - square fluctuation of the soliton displacement . the above dependences on @xmath40 of the mean - square mnls soliton fluctuations coincide completely with those in the case of the nls soliton  @xcite . nevertheless , there is a substantial difference between nls and mnls equations . while the correlation functions for the nls soliton do not contain soliton parameters ( in dimensionless units ) , these parameters enter explicitly into the r.h.s . of  ( [ 15 ] ) for the mnls equation . therefore , we can reduce the gordon - haus jitter for the mnls soliton by varying soliton parameters . in fig . 1 we demonstrate this effect in terms of variables @xmath19 and @xmath20 . it is seen that the function  ( [ 16 ] ) smoothly decreases when @xmath19 approaches @xmath65 . the role of the optical energy @xmath61 is depicted on fig . 2 . as follows from  ( [ 17 ] ) , we have @xmath66 for @xmath67 and @xmath68 for @xmath69 . it is seen that the function  ( [ 16 ] ) grows significantly for all @xmath61 for @xmath69 , while the same growth for @xmath67  is displayed to a lesser extent , including non - monotone behavior for small @xmath61 . as regards the applicability of the above result on the soliton jitter suppression to actual femtosecond optical solitons , we believe that the mnls equation is the true integrable model to start with the account for the third - order dispersion and the raman self - frequency shift . it should be noted that in the adiabatic approximation the third - order dispersion does not contribute to the mnls soliton velocity and width , just as for the nls soliton  @xcite . the raman effect contribution can be calculated additively as an extra perturbation to the mnls soliton , within the framework of the mnls soliton perturbation theory  @xcite . in so doing , a value of @xmath6 should be carefully reconciled with the specific conditions of femtosecond pulse propagation . it is worth noting that there exists a possibility  @xcite to partially compensate for the raman self - frequency shift effect , as applied to femtosecond optical pulses . corresponding results will be published elsewhere .    in conclusion , we have shown that for solitons of the mnls equation which can serve as the integrable model for the description of ultrashort soliton dynamics , the gordon - haus jitter can be significantly reduced by means of matching soliton parameters alone . we stress that this reduction is non - perturbative with respect to @xmath6 , i.e. , it can not be revealed in the framework of the nls equation with @xmath6-dependent term considered as a perturbation . though the above result is valid within the adiabatic approximation of the mnls soliton perturbation theory , we believe it describes the main features of this phenomenon for ultrashort optical pulses .

( 2000 ) found the first examples of dwarfs in the transition region between the basic l and t spectral properties . burgasser et al . ( 2000 ) have observed a dozen t dwarfs at 1.0 - 2.5  @xmath0 m and have demonstrated the potential for defining a t sequence based on infrared indices . neither the details of a t classification scheme nor the manner by which the two classes might be smoothly conjoined has yet been proposed . keys to determining these are : ( 1 ) obtaining a larger set of infrared spectra of l and t dwarfs ; ( 2 ) observing in finer detail the transition between the classes ; and ( 3 ) developing an accurate infrared classification scheme for l dwarfs to complement the optical schemes . the last is essential , because late l and t dwarfs can not be easily classified optically due to their faintness . several groups already have begun exploring infrared schemes for l dwarfs ( delfosse et al . 1999 ; tokunaga & kobayashi 1999 ; reid et al . 2001 ; testi et al . 2001 ) . this paper briefly describes a unified classification system that we have developed for l and t dwarfs . details are found in geballe et al .

based quantum computing @xcite and as an initial state for grover s algorithm @xcite . in this paper , the restriction to symmetric states is used to simplify the calculation of 3 qubit local unitary invariants . the entanglement of an @xmath3 qubit state , as defined by any measure , remains invariant under local unitary operators of the form @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . the set of polynomial invariant quantities of a multi - qubit state are not limited to entanglement measures , however . in this paper , the invariants of an arbitrary three qubit symmetric state are calculated explicitly and their full achievable region is calculated . any multi - particle state has a set of polynomials in the coefficients of the state which are invariant under the action of various local operators @xcite . in particular , a 3 qubit state , under the action of unitaries which act only locally on one qubit , is known to have 5 algebraically independent invariants ( excepting the trace norm and @xmath7 invariants ) @xcite . one is free to chose the representation of the 5 invariants , as any polynomial in the invariants is additionally an invariant of the state . one representation that is particularly convenient for 3 qubit states under local unitary operators is    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the pairwise concurrence between parties @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath1 is the 3-tangle @xcite , and @xmath2 is the kempe invariant @xcite . these quantities are defined for a 3 qubit state , @xmath12 , as follows ,    @xmath13    @xmath14    @xmath15    where the @xmath16 in ( 2 ) are the square roots of the eigenvalues , in decreasing order , of @xmath17 . here , @xmath18 is the reduced density operator of the state having traced out all parties other than @xmath10 and @xmath11 . note , also , that in ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) we have adopted the convention of summing over repeated indices . this choice of invariants is particularly useful as it uses some of the most prevalent entanglement measures in the concurrence and 3-tangle . it s natural to consider entanglement measures as invariants since by definition they should not change under local operations .    it would be interesting to completely map the space of these 5 invariants , but the calculations are difficult for arbitrary states , and the 5 dimensional picture would be unwieldy to describe . instead , by examining a particular subset of states , the number of parameters and invariants can be reduced to a more manageable amount . in the next section this is done for the subset of states which are symmetric under permutation of the party labels . symmetric states offer a significant simplification to the picture of 3 qubit invariants . clearly if a state is symmetric under relabeling of parties , each of the two - party reduced density operators , @xmath18 , will be identical . this then causes @xmath19 and effectively reduces the number of invariants to 3 , which will be denoted ,      the goal now is to calculate these invariants for a general 3 qubit symmetric state and describe the space of allowed values for these invariants . before doing so , however , we can further simplify the problem by examining how the symmetric subspace of 3 qubit states reduces the parameters on which the invariants depend . are the dicke basis states which represent an equal superposition of all possible states with @xmath10 `` 0 '' entries and @xmath23 `` 1 '' entries . they are obviously symmetric since @xmath24 permutes the parties of the state and the sum is an equal superposition of all possible permutations . in this representation , the 3 qubit symmetric state has 4 complex coefficients , @xmath25 , which reduce to 6 real parameters after normalization and the factoring out of an overall phase . while the invariants can be calculated from these 6 real parameters , it s useful to apply a set of local unitaries to the state to reduce the number of parameters . the calculation of the invariants then becomes more concise while still containing the same information since the invariants should not change under local unitaries . such a simplification was investigated in [ 11 ] . using almost the same argument , we show in the following that an arbitrary 3 qubit symmetric state is equivalent under local unitaries to the state            one can compute the majorana polynomial @xcite of @xmath33 , by projecting it onto the unnormalized coherent state @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is an arbitrary complex number . the resulting inner product is the following polynomial in @xmath35 ,      by the first fundamental theorem of algebra , the roots of this polynomial , @xmath37 , known as the majorana roots , uniquely determine the coefficients @xmath25 up to some overall scaling factor . so to show that two states are the same , it suffices to show that they have the same majorana roots . we will exploit this fact to show that @xmath33 can be represented as      where @xmath39 , and @xmath40 by showing that ( 11 ) has the same majorana roots as ( 9 ) for some choice of @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 . before computing the majorana roots of ( 11 ) , we can factor out @xmath44 from the state to express it as ,              where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the goal is to demonstrate that one can solve for a choice of @xmath52 and @xmath53 that will satisfy ( 14 ) having the same roots as ( 10 ) . this creates the following constraints on @xmath52 and @xmath53 ,          equations ( 15 - 17 ) provide sufficient constraints on @xmath52 and @xmath53 to identify a representation ( 11 ) which is the same state as ( 9 ) . one can then construct a local unitary operator of the form @xmath58 , where @xmath59 . applying this to ( 12 ) results in ,                this canonical form is a useful tool in examining the local unitary invariants of 3-qubit symmetric states . other canonical forms and representations for 3-qubit states are known , but this one provides considerable simplification to symmetric states in particular and leaves them symmetric after the rotation . if one were to transform ( 20 ) into one of the general 3-qubit canonical forms developed by acn et . al . in @xcite one would get the following state ,        returning to ( 20 ) , it s clear that in this form an arbitrary 3 qubit symmetric state depends entirely on the three real parameters , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . in terms of these parameters , the invariants are ,        it s interesting then to examine the space of allowed invariants . shown in figure 1 are the invariants of @xmath71 randomly generated symmetric 3 qubit states , where the states were generated by sampling randomly over the allowed values of @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . at a first glance it s interesting to note that the 3-tangle and kempe invariants achieve their maximum values of 1 on the symmetric subspace , but the concurrence does not due its monogamy constraints . a straightforward maximization over the state parameters reveals a maximum concurrence of @xmath72 in the symmetric subspace . the points of figure 1 appear to lie almost on a surface , but closer inspection reveals they in fact fill a narrow volume , the boundaries to which can be calculated . the expressions , ( 22 -

27 ) are the minimum set of constraints required to describe the region . because there is a bijective map between the invariants and the state parameters , each invariant triple which lies within the region satisfying ( 25 - 27 ) can be mapped to a 3 qubit symmetric state , and therefor the entire region is achievable . a similar approach could be used to analyze the the invariants of @xmath3 qubits for the symmetric subspace . the representation in @xcite extends to symmetric @xmath3 qubit states resulting in @xmath76 real parameters . 3 qubits , in particular , can be fully analyzed and visualized because the numbers of invariants and state parameters are suitably low . additionally , the 3 qubit case conveniently resulted in an invertible map between the state parameters and the invariants , making the calculation of the region more manageable . turning to the @xmath3 qubit case , it would be interesting to identify an algebraically independent set of @xmath76 polynomial invariants for symmetric states . those invariants could potentially then be calculated in terms of the @xmath76 state parameters . the fact that this map was invertible in 3 qubits is remarkable , and will not necessarily be true for the @xmath3 qubit case , though it it certainly worth examining . 20 c. h. bennett , g. brassard , c. crpeau , r. jozsa , a. peres , and w. k. wootters . teleporting an unknown quantum state via dual classical and einstein -

( [ solution ] ) propagates with a superluminal phase velocity given by @xmath13 . the independence of the phase velocity from the field frequency implies that in free space the group velocity is also superluminal and is equal to the phase velocity .    in practical experiments the diffraction free region is limited by the finite extent of the beam . as evidenced by fig . [ fig:1](a ) , the maximum diffraction free propagation distance depends on the radius @xmath14 of the optical element used for producing the beam and on the axicon angle @xmath2 , and is given by @xmath15 . at propagation distances greater than @xmath16 , the beam diffracts very quickly , spreading the energy over an annular region .    in our experiment , the optical element used to generate the bessel beam is a conical mirror with a radius of @xmath17 @xmath1 and an apex angle of @xmath18 . the mirror parameters correspond to a non - diffractive distance of @xmath0 @xmath1 and lead to the phase and group velocities exceeding @xmath19 by @xmath20 . the non - diffractive propagation was verified by spatial characterization of the bessel beam . the experimental setup used for these measurements is shown in fig . [ fig:1](b ) . the light source is a continuous wave ( cw ) he : ne laser operating at @xmath21 @xmath22 . the horizontally polarized beam is first expanded so that the resulting collimated light has a waist slightly larger than the diameter of the conical mirror , and then is transmitted through a polarizing beamsplitter ( pbs ) . after the pbs , the gaussian beam passes through a @xmath23 waveplate , reflects off the conical mirror , passes through the waveplate a second time , changing to a vertical polarization , and is reflected by the pbs . in this way , 65% of the gaussian beam power is converted into a nondiffractive beam . the intensity profile at various positions along the propagation axis was recorded using a ccd camera . a microscope was constructed to magnify the intensity profile by a factor of 3.5 so the camera could resolve fine transverse features of the diffraction pattern . the different radial intensity profiles recorded are shown in fig . [ fig:3d ] and are almost identical over the entire diffraction free region with a central peak width which is consistent with the theoretical expectation of @xmath24 @xmath25 , where 2.405 is the first zero of the bessel function .    we compared the measured intensity pattern with the pattern calculated numerically by the rayleigh - sommerfield diffraction integral @xcite ( fig . [ fig:3](a ) ) . for this calculation we assumed the amplitude transmission function of the mirror is given by : @xmath26 the intensity of the central peak as a function of the propagation distance is shown in fig . [ fig:3](b ) together with a the numerical prediction . the central peak intensity behavior is determined by the fact that the light that constructively interferes to create the peak at a longitudinal position @xmath3 arrives from a region of the mirror that has a circumference of @xmath27 . the intensity thus grows linearly for small values of @xmath3 and then decreases when the intensity decrease of the gaussian profile of the input beam is more rapid then the linear increase of the circumference . the oscillations at the end of the curve are due to the fresnel diffraction from the outer edge of the mirror . the 73-cm non - diffractive distance estimated with geometrical optics agreed with that obtained from the numerical calculation and with the experimental results . the phase and group velocities in free space were measured in order to verify that the propagation of the bessel beam exceeds the speed of light . we implemented an interferometric design using cw light for the phase velocity measurement , and femtosecond pulses for the group velocity measurement . the design , shown in fig . [ fig:1]b , is a mixed michelson interferometer , with a plane mirror in one arm and a conical mirror in the other . in the output channel of the interferometer we placed a ccd camera to record the on - axis intensity as a function of the camera s longitudinal position @xmath3 . we placed a @xmath23 waveplate into each arm to permit independent manipulation of the intensity of the two beams . this arrangement allowed us to compare the group and phase velocities of the bessel beam relative to those of the gaussian beam ( that are equal to @xmath19 ) and to observe the relatively small superluminal effect expected . gaussian and bessel beams have both the same frequency @xmath28 but different phase velocities , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , along the @xmath3 direction . thus they will show interference fringes spaced at @xmath31 . in our case , with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , we find @xmath34 . measuring the spacing of the interference fringes thus yields the magnitude of @xmath35 . in order to determine the sign of @xmath35 , and hence whether the bessel beam is propagating superluminally , we varied the angle @xmath36 between the direction of propagation of the gaussian and bessel beam . by doing so , we set the phase velocity component of the gaussian beam in the direction of propagation of the bessel beam to @xmath37 . if the phase velocity of the bessel beam exceeds that of the gaussian beam then with increasing @xmath36 between @xmath38 , the interference fringe spacing @xmath39 should also increase . experimentally , we aligned the gaussian beam along the optical rail and manipulated @xmath36 by slightly tilting the conical mirror . we determined the value of @xmath36 by displacing the ccd along the optical rail and recording the relative transverse positions of the centres of the two beams at each location . figure [ fig:7 ] displays the measured interference period as a function of @xmath36 together with a theoretical fit in which the axicon angle @xmath2 was the variable parameter . in particular , note that with increasing misalignment , @xmath39 is increasing , indicating that the phase velocity of the bessel beam is higher than that of the gaussian beam . the data give a phase velocity of @xmath40 which is consistent with the expected value @xmath41 , corresponding to an axicon angle of @xmath42 . the group velocity measurement was performed using 200 fs pulses at @xmath43 @xmath22 from a ti : sapphire mode - locked laser pumped by a @xmath44 @xmath22 solid - state laser . the optics were replaced to accommodate the new wavelength . the gaussian and bessel beams were aligned with each other to within @xmath45 @xmath46 . the intensity in the output channel of the interferometer was measured with the ccd camera . when there is no temporal overlap between the gaussian and the bessel pulse , the ccd measured the sum of the intensities of the two pulses . on the other hand , when the pulse arrival was simultaneous , the intensity was affected by interference . suppose that for some configuration of the interferometer the ccd is located in a position of maximum visibility . if the camera is now translated along the propagation axis away from the pbs by a distance of @xmath39 , the interferometer arm with the planar mirror must be moved by a distance @xmath47 in order to restore the same visibility . therefore , the bessel pulse travels an extra distance of @xmath39 in the time the gaussian pulse travels a distance of @xmath48 , giving    @xmath49    in the experiment , we acquired several pairs @xmath50 for which the interference visibility is optimized . the interference was observed by scanning the plane mirror over a distance of @xmath51 wavelengths with a piezoelectric transducer . for a given position @xmath3 of the camera , the interference visibility over a range of plane mirror positions was evaluated ( fig . [ fig:8 ] )    the linear relationship predicted by eq . ( [ eq : groupeq ] ) is evidenced by fig . [ fig:9 ] , and is characterized by a linear regression slope @xmath52 . the negativity of the slope indicates that the relative path length of the gaussian beam had to be reduced as the overall travel distance increased ( i.e. smaller @xmath3 values ) , which corresponds to a superluminal group velocity , @xmath53c = ( 1.000150\\pm0.000006)c$ ] . this velocity corresponds to the apex angle of @xmath54 . we have spatially and temporally characterized an optical bessel beam produced using a conical mirror propagating in free space . we ascertained the beam to have a constant peak size over the propagation distance determined by the properties of the conical mirror . the phase and group velocities of the beam were determined with an interferometric setup to be superluminal , with values of @xmath40 and @xmath55 , respectively , which is consistent with the theoretical prediction . this work was supported by nserc , cfi , aif , quantum@xmath56 and cifar ( a.l . ) ; "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " we experimentally analyze a bessel beam produced with a conical mirror , paying particular attention to its superluminal and diffraction - free properties .   we spatially characterized the beam in the radial and on - axis dimensions , and verified that the central peak does not spread over a propagation distance of @xmath0 @xmath1 .   in addition , we measured the superluminal phase and group velocities of the beam in free space .   both spatial and temporal measurements show good agreement with the theoretical predictions .

'' in this work we summarize @xcite and expand on a new scenario for striped superconductors where the interplay between inhomogeneous superfluid density and phase fluctuations determines the critical temperature .    in their undoped state , cuprates behave as antiferromagnetic ( af ) mott insulators and it is precisely upon doping with holes that these strongly correlated materials become superconductors . recent experiments seem to indicate that inhomogeneously textured ( intrinsically nanoscale ) phases characterize the quantum state of high temperature superconductors . this is , probably , not surprising in retrospect since these are complex materials with competing time and length scales arising from different interactions . a relevant and non - trivial question is , however , whether those textures are essential to drive the phase coherent state , i.e. , a meissner phase . neutron scattering experiments have proven to be a very useful tool in investigating magnetic and superconducting properties of high-@xmath0 cuprate oxides . with improved sample quality and resolution there is reliable evidence for an incommensurate structure in the spin susceptibility . on the other hand , recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) data suggest a one - dimensional ( 1d ) like electronic structure consistent with clustering of charge carriers into 1d channels @xcite . therefore , although the orientation , width , length and dynamics of the channels remains to be elucidated , both the above classes of experiments appear to confirm a new paradigm of spin and charge ordering in high-@xmath0 superconductors : the `` stripe '' phase .    motivated by this new paradigm we introduced @xcite a class of inhomogeneous microscopic models which capture the magnetic and superconducting properties of these strongly correlated materials . the origin(s ) of the mesoscopic skeleton of stripe segments in the cuo@xmath3 planes is presently unclear and several mechanisms could be responsible , such as local spin - orbit coupling , jahn - teller distortions , oxygen buckling at the stripe , and/or other magnetoelastic effects . ( local charge - lattice coupling may be an important source of texture formation . ) we showed , in particular , that appropriate inhomogeneous interactions that break magnetic symmetries are distinctive in inducing substantial pair binding of holes , as well as explaining the magnetic neutron scattering properties . moreover , based upon the phenomenology of our microscopic model we developed a mean - field ( `` josephson spaghetti '' ) model which provides a scenario for the macroscopic superconducting state . we also discussed the connection of the resulting inhomogeneity - induced superconductivity to recent experimental evidence for a linear relation between magnetic incommensurability and the superconducting transition temperature , as a function of doping . in a different work @xcite we studied the spectral properties of these inhomogeneous models and found , consistent with experiments @xcite , a flat band and the correct distribution of quasiparticle weights . in previous work @xcite we have assumed static magnetic inhomogeneities . certainly , the stripe segments in real materials are likely to have an intrinsic dynamics on a characteristic time scale @xmath4 . we assume that this time is large enough for attractive forces to produce bound states of two holes . on the other hand , this stripe dynamics will probably restore the @xmath5 spin rotation invariance on time scales greater than @xmath4 . @xmath5 symmetry does not have to be broken statically . in the present manuscript we also discuss an alternative approach where the magnetic inhomogeneities follow the hole , i.e. , the stripe phase is dynamically generated by the holes . this model we call the _ selfconsistent perturbing hole _ ( sph ) model since the hole itself carries the perturbation . the main qualitative difference between both classes of models is the absence of a broken lattice translational symmetry state in the sph case . otherwise , the basic phenomenology is qualitatively the same : holes pair in stripes as a consequence of the existence of an af background ( avoiding a possible global phase separation ) . the pairing mechanism is kinetic exchange - interaction based and is provided by magnetic inhomogeneities that _ locally _ break spin - rotational invariance . in the superfluid phase , it is argued that a phase - locked state is generated as a consequence of a coherent josephson tunneling of the hole pairs between and along stripes @xcite . in this section we will present two classes of inhomogeneous models . the first model was already introduced in ref . @xcite , where the basic microscopic scenario starts from a homogeneous @xmath1-@xmath2 hamiltonian as background @xmath6 but , to mimic the stripe segments , we add inhomogeneous magnetic interactions . these inhomogeneous terms break translational invariance and spin - rotational @xmath5 symmetry locally : @xmath7 with @xmath8 , representing the magnetic perturbation of a static local _ ising _ anisotropy , locally lowering spin symmetry ( named a @xmath1-@xmath9 model ) . only a few links ( where the stripes are located ) have this lowered spin symmetry . this ising anisotropy is also sufficient to produce a spin gap . pair binding of holes in this class of models is substantial @xcite . this substantial binding energy is achieved as the energy for two holes falls much faster with @xmath1 than twice the energy of one hole . it is interesting to make the following remarks : suppose that a stripe segment is represented by the 1d @xmath1-@xmath10 model @xmath11 one can show @xcite that , within the ground state subspace ( for a given number of holes ) , this hamiltonian maps into the attractive spinless fermion model @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and which certainly has a superconducting phase ( i.e. , correlation exponent @xmath14 ) @xcite . in this particular model , it turns out that ( e.g. , at half - filling for @xmath15 ) the isolated stripe segment belongs to the luttinger liquid universality class . notice , however , that our stripes are embedded in an af background . this background provides a strong boundary condition that results in an additional attractive potential for the holes in the stripe . as a result , an enhanced superconducting region is expected @xcite , avoiding alternative charge density wave phases or phase segregation .    knowing that perturbating the system by breaking magnetic symmetries is an efficient mechanism to achieve substantial binding of carriers , some natural questions arise : what would happen if the hole itself carries this perturbation ? would this process be sufficient to generate a stripe phase ? would the binding energy be still appreciable in the thermodynamic limit ?            in this hamiltonian @xmath18 is the ocupation number of holes at site @xmath19 and @xmath20 , @xmath21 are the usual spin operators @xcite . the presence of a hole at site @xmath19 perturbs the magnetic links in the directions defined by @xmath22 by lowering the spin symmetry and making them more ising - like . this model is perhaps more natural on physical grounds than the @xmath1-@xmath9 one . magnetoelastic effects caused by the presence of the hole , or buckling of the oxygens close to the carrier may easily produce an ising - like anisotropy . upon doping with holes it is not obvious what the extra hole does to the environment . since these are strongly correlated materials , the extra holes could have a stronger influence on the system than just those effects produced by simple hopping dynamics . the models considered above are different in some respects . while in the model of eqs . [ h],[h - inh ] translational symmetry has been explicitly broken ( i.e. , adding @xmath23 ) the model defined by @xmath24 is translationally symmetric , and the only symmetry that has been explicitly broken is the spin @xmath5 symmetry around each hole . this fact has some direct experimental consequences . as already discussed in ref . @xcite , the @xmath1-@xmath9 model has an inhomogeneous hole density , as they prefer to occupy sites where the magnetic links have been weakened ( the stripes ) . this is not the case for the sph model since , as the translational symmetry has not been broken , the holes will be found with equal probability on every lattice site . this fundamental difference could be resolved by a scanning tunneling microscope experiment .    in this work we will not address the issue of stripe formation in the sph model , but rather concentrate on the hole pairing in those textures . clearly there will be a competition between kinetic and magnetic energies . while the first will try to delocalize the pair , the former will contribute to the pairing . in fig . [ scaling ] we show the binding energy ( defined as @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the ground state energy in the subspace with @xmath27 holes ) as a function of @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is the size of the system ) . @xmath1-@xmath2 models in 1d ( diamonds ) and 2d ( triangles ) have zero or negligible binding in the extrapolated thermodynamic limit . the model labeled as @xmath1-@xmath9 corresponding to the hamiltonian of eqs . [ h ] , [ h - inh ] in 1d has substantial binding in the thermodynamic limit . that model corresponds to placing a perturbation like eq . [ h - inh ] every 4 sites . the model labeled as @xmath1-@xmath2 + @xmath24 is the one we are mostly interested in this work . it has appreciable binding of holes in the thermodynamic limit , although not as strong as in the @xmath1-@xmath9 model . in the calculations we have taken @xmath30 ( i.e. , the hole perturbs up to second neighbors ) . for @xmath31 the model reduces trivially to the @xmath1-@xmath2 model , as the links close to the holes are magnetically inactive . therefore @xmath32 must be greater or equal to 2 to show any new behavior . in order to get information about the bound state we have calculated the correlation function @xmath33 , which gives the probability of finding a hole at site @xmath27 if there is one at site @xmath34 . we remark again that the density of holes is constant and equal to @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 the number of holes and @xmath29 the size of the system ) for every site @xmath27 in the case of @xmath1-@xmath2 + @xmath24 . in fig . [ noni ] , upper panel we show this correlation function for the cases @xmath37 and @xmath38 when there are two holes in a 16 sites chain . as expected , the pair is more strongly bound for @xmath38 . in a real material there must be a decreasing function of the perturbation carried by the hole with distance . in our case that perturbation is constant . in fig . [ noni ] lower panel , we show the same correlation function for @xmath37 and different @xmath1 values . the pair evolves from being tightly bound to delocalization as the kinetic energy is increased . it is worth noting that even when the holes are not very close the binding energy scales to a finite value . 9 j. eroles , g. ortiz , a.v . balatsky , and a.r . bishop , europhys .

( see fig.[fig : beam_optics ] ) . charged hadrons from the internal target are swept away from the @xmath9-quanta path by the u70 accelerator magnetic field and do nt enter the beam line . a small number of hadrons in the electron beam are produced by neutron interactions with converter1 . electrons from converter1 are guided by the accelerator magnetic field to the beam line entrance . the output electron beam momentum is defined by the radial position of the internal target . the converter1 placement in the accelerator chamber allows to obtain more intense beams ( @xmath10 electrons per @xmath11 protons ) but reduces the available electron beam momentum range to 25 - 45  gev . a further decreasing of initial momenta of electrons was obtained using an oriented silicon crystal @xcite ( converter2 ) which was placed before the analyzing magnet m5 . the electron beam after converter2 has a wide momentum spectrum due to bremsstrahlung radiation . the fields of the magnetic elements are setup proportionally to a beam momentum . finally we have electron beam with any required energy from  1 gev up to  45 gev . it usually took us about 15 minutes to tune the beam line elements for given energy . the beam momentum spread was @xmath12p / p @xmath4  3  % at 27  gev and was too large to study the energy resolution of pbwo@xmath3 crystals . so we decided to install momentum tagging system to measure the momentum of each electron . it consisted of four drift chamber stations ( dc ) and a 4 meter long spectrometer magnet denoted m14 ( see fig . [ fig : dc_setup ] ) . the magnet deflected the beam in the horizontal plane by 55  mrad . the magnet current was adjustable in order to provide the same bending angle for all energies of the electron beam . the _ x _ and _ y _ positions of the charged particle were measured in each dc station with a pair of drift chambers in each view , which shared the same gas volume . each chamber has a @xmath13@xmath14 sensitive area . the third station , dc3 , has only a pair of chambers measuring the _ x _ coordinate . all together four dc stations consisted of fourteen drift chambers . the internal structure of a pair of drift chambers is shown in fig . [ fig : dc_struct ] .            each drift cell is formed by a signal ( sense ) wire in the center , field wires at the edges of the cell and cathode planes perpendicular to the beam direction . the signal wires are separated by 2.4  cm corresponding to a maximum drift distance of 1.2  cm . the signal wires of the second chamber were shifted by 1.2  cm to resolve the left - right ambiguity . the distance between signal wires and cathode planes is 5  mm . the signal wires were made of gold plated tungsten ( 20  @xmath15 diameter ) and field wires , beryllium - copper alloy ( 100  @xmath15 diameter ) . the cathode planes were made of graphite coated ( 5  @xmath15 ) mylar ( total thickness 25  @xmath15 ) . to complete the electrostatic shielding of the modules , aluminized mylar ( 25  @xmath15 mylar and less then 1  @xmath15 al ) was placed on the sides of the box . each chamber required two high voltages : the cathode voltage ( hvc ) , and the voltage on the field wires ( hvf ) to make a uniform electric field along the cell . during the experiment all chambers were operated with hvc= -1.8 kv and hvf= -2.9 kv .        a mixture of argon ( 70% ) and isobutane ( 30% ) gas was used . the operating voltages gave a field gradient of 1  kv / cm in the main part of the drift space , which is enough to provide for a saturated drift velocity . the design of the dc internal structure and operating voltages were the result of a compromise between predictions of a garfield simulation for a constant drift velocity within the drift cell , track detection efficiency , and our requirement of minimum materials .    assuming that the drift velocity is constant over the entire cell , we achieved the required track precision . the actual measured time distribution function for one of the drift chambers , @xmath16 , is shown in fig . [ fig : t_r_func ] where _ x _ was obtained from a track fit over the three other dc stations . it shows some non - uniformity , so the precision of the track reconstruction can be improved further by fitting the drift velocity as a function of _ x_. the dc efficiency is shown in fig .  [ fig : dceff ] . we reach the @xmath1790% level over most of the cell . the drift time was measured by lecroy  3377 tdc with a 1  ns / count accuracy . the fraction of electrons in the beam for various momenta were estimated in the following way . at the end of the beam line , after dc4 ( see fig.[fig : dc_setup ] ) , we place a box containing a 5@xmath185 matrix of lead tungstate scintillating crystals . using information from the drift chambers , beam particles which hit within a @xmath19 region in the center of the crystal matrix have been selected . the crystals are square , 27 mm on each of the lateral side and 220 mm in length . for these events , the energy deposit in the entire calorimeter was measured . fig [ fig : mom10 ] shows the distribution of these measured energies for 10 gev electron beam data . this is the worst case in terms of electron beam purity . we see clean muon and electron peaks at about @xmath20gev and @xmath21gev , respectively and the energy deposit from hadronic showers between them . the relatively large muon fraction was useful to monitor the stability of the calorimeter prototype properties . the events with the energy deposit greater than 0.9 of mean value of the peak corresponding to the beam energy have been assigned to electrons . the rest of the events are background particles , muons and hadrons . the measured fractions of electrons in the beam for each beam energy are shown in table  [ tab : frac ] . all fractions are determined to an absolute accuracy of 1% . .fraction of electrons in the beam at various energies [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : beam_mom ]    @xmath22    from ( [ eq : sigma2x ] ) we found @xmath23 = 0.16  mm , which corresponds to a single chamber resolution to be 160*@xmath24 . when we put ( [ eq : sigma2x ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma2 t ] ) in equation ( [ eq : sigma2t_full ] ) , we obtain @xmath25    the results of the calculations using ( [ eq : sigma2th ] ) are given in column 4 of the table [ tab : beam_mom ] as the measured values for a beam momentum resolution . the last column of the same table shows the measured by our spectrometer beam momentum spread ( @xmath26/p ) in % , where @xmath26 represents fwhm/2.35 of the main peak since the momentum distribution is non - gaussian . the geometry of this beam line was reproduced in a geant monte carlo simulation taking into account the real materials distribution . the moliere theory , corrected for finite angle scattering , was used to calculate the effect of multiple coulomb scattering on the charged particle trajectory . the position resolution of each drift chamber station was taken as a gaussian distribution with @xmath27  mm . the momentum resolution was reconstructed using the same cuts as the real data . the results are presented in table [ tab : beam_mom ] . where , @xmath28 is the relative error of the electron momentum . @xmath23 and @xmath2 are the r.m.s . of the gaussian fit of the corresponding distribution . the dependence of @xmath29 on energy was also simulated by geant . the results are shown in the fig . [ fig : sigmap ] . solid line represents monte carlo simulation , filled squares real measurements . estimated errors of the experimental data are inside the markers . there is a good agreement between the simulation data and the real measurements which are shown in table [ tab : beam_mom ] and fig.[fig : sigmap ] . it proves the validity of our drift chamber resolution determination described above . the experience of long - term operation of a modified beam line for electrons with energies in the range of 1 to 45 gev described in this paper shows that this technique significantly expands the possibilities to study precise energy and coordinate resolutions of scintillating crystals . independent of the momentum spread of the electron beam at the level of 1 to 5% at energies from 45 down to 1 gev , the momentum tagging station gives a beam momentum resolution from 0.13 to 2% in the same energy range . the precision is limited by drift chamber spatial resolution and multiple coulomb scattering on a material in the beam line . geant monte carlo simulations of the resolution agree very well with the experimental results . an opportunity to switch the beam line from electrons to high energy pions with high intensities ( up to 10@xmath0 e@xmath30 and 10@xmath31 per spill ) allows the study radiation hardness properties of scintillating crystals both for electrons and hadrons with moderate dose rates of up to 100 rad / hour . these dose rates are similar to the ones that will be in btev at fermilab and in cms at cern . integrated doses up to several krad can be accumulated in this setup in a relatively short time . we would like to thank the ihep management for providing us a beam line and accelerator time for our testbeam studies . special thanks to fermilab for providing equipment for data acquisition . this work was partially supported by the u. s. national science foundation and the department of energy .

( 2005 ) of 25.724 and 25.501 for the v and i filters respectively . the deep hst / acs images show an unprecedented level of detail in the ngc346/n66 complex . the ngc346 cluster at the center is resolved into at least three subclusters , and a myriad of small compact clusters is visible throughout the region . some of these clusters appear to be still embedded in dust and nebulosity , and they might be sites of recent or ongoing star formation . the diffuse nebulosity is due to the presence of h@xmath12 and [ oiii ] 4959 , 5007 in the v filter , which indicate the bright underlying hii region . this extends to the n with arches and ragged filaments , but is delineated to the s - sw by a sharp fan - like _ ridge _ , which encompasses the entire cluster . this ridge is especially evident in the h@xmath0 image of the region ( plate  2 ) . extensive dust lanes are well visible along this _ ridge_. dust patches are also visible throughout the region , most likely the remnant of the original molecular cloud @xcite . the v and i photometric data with photometric error smaller than 0.1 mag was used to construct the v , v - i color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the entire ngc346 region . the cmd ( small black dots in fig .  [ fig4 ] ) contains @xmath1 80000 stars . thanks to the high photometric accuracy obtained with the acs , these stars produce a very clean cmd , with a well defined narrow main sequence ( ms ) , down to v @xmath1 26 . the photometric errors in magnitude and color are indicated directly in the cmd , as side bars . a pronounced old main sequence turnoff is clearly visible , at v @xmath1 22 , and so is the red clump , at v @xmath1 19.5 . the cmd morphology also reveals a young population , indicated by the bright , blue ms , extending from the ms of the old smc stellar population . below v @xmath1 21 mag a group of very red faint stars is detected to the right of the ms plausibly , this split ms could be due to differential reddening . however , the absence of such a split in the upper part of the ms led us to believe that these are stars that are less massive than @xmath13 m@xmath13 ( down to 0.6 m@xmath13 ) , which formed with the rest of the central cluster but have not reached the ms yet ( pre - ms stars ) . analyzing separately the stellar content of the individual clusters we resolve in the acs images , we can better characterize the local stellar population . the orange dots in figure  [ fig4 ] highlight the observational cmd for the core of ngc346 . they indicate stars within a radius of @xmath1 8@xmath14 from the cluster center . this is superimposed to the cmd of the entire region ( small black dots ) . we superimposed to these cmds isochrones for pre - ms stars from @xcite , and for ms and post - ms stars from @xcite , and @xcite , to define the age and the nature of the population observed in the central cluster . we find presence of at least two different populations :    1 .   a composite smc field population covering a wide range in age , but dominated by the 4 gyr component , 2 .   a very young population of age @xmath13 - 5 myr . stars less massive than @xmath13 m@xmath13 ( down to 0.6 m@xmath13 ) are still in the pre - ms phase , approaching the ms .    an intermediate age population ( @xmath1150 myr ) might also be present . the pre - ms stars are , as expected , faint ( v @xmath15 21 ) and red ( 1.5@xmath16v - i @xmath152.2 ) . the cmd isochrone fit indicates they likely formed with the rest of the cluster ( @xmath1 3 - 5 myr ago ) , but have not reached the ms yet . they are in the mass range 0.6 - 3 m@xmath2 . their spatial distribution is shown in figure  [ fig5 ] . they appear concentrated at the center of ngc346 , mostly in the central subclusters , but also in the small compact clusters that are located on a direction which is perpendicular to the ngc346 main body , extending to the ne . their spatial location appears coincident with the clumps of neutral material identified by @xcite . the spatial density of the pre - ms stars appear to decrease as we move from the center towards the s - sw _ ridge _ , where we observe the dust lanes . as also suggested by @xcite , it is likely that the region , and especially the _ ridge _ , may be a site of more recent or on going star formation , and the forming stars are still embedded in dust and too faint to be visually detected in the acs images . the region around n66/ngc346 is a remarkable region that has displayed a high level of activity in the recent past . to the ne of n66/ngc346 there is a known sn remnant , snr0057 - 7226 , first identified as a bright source in _ einstein _ x - ray observations @xcite . from the expansion velocity derived from fuse observations of @xmath1150 km s@xmath17 @xcite , we can derive a dynamical timescale of 2 @xmath8 10@xmath18 yr and set a lower limit to the epoch of the sn explosion . it is clear that snr0057 - 7226 has been interacting with the surrounding region , and the o vi ciii and x - ray emission observed @xcite arises from the shock interaction . two concentric bubbles are seen to the ne in the h@xmath0 region shown in plate  2 : we believe they are most likely shaped by the powerful winds of hd5980 . observations of @xcite and @xcite have painted a detailed picture of the molecular gas and dust component in n66/ngg346 . their observations indicate that the molecular gas has mostly been dissociated by the uv radiation of the hottest stars : what has not been dissociated is detected in small , compact clumps , which appear to be spatially concident with the regions where we observe the pre - main sequence stars @xcite . specifically , their co(2 - 1 ) sest observations indicate clumps of emission in the ngc346 central cluster , and , even stronger emission along the perpendicular direction to the ngc346 main body , to the ne . these clumps are exactly where we find the highest concentration of pre - ms stars . there appear not to be much molecular gas or dust outside the ngc346 main body , casting the doubt that the sw _ ridge _ might not be at the boundary with a molecular cloud as initially suspected @xcite . we have shown that n66/ngc346 is a complex region that has been shaped by the evolution of the most massive stars , some of which have already exploded as supernova and are compressing the central region from different directions . the outstanding question will be to understand how star formation has been triggered and has been progressing in this region . further necessary work on this region includes spectroscopic characterization of the pre - main sequence stars , and spectroscopic observations of the gas kinematics . on the theoretical side , ngc346 can easily become the ideal laboratory to test current theories for star formation at low masses . bouret , j.c . , lanz , t. , hillier , d.j . , heap , s. r. , hubeny , i. , lennon , d.j . , smith , l.j . , & evans , c.j .  2003 , , 595 , 1182 contursi , a. , lequeux , j. , cesarsky , d. , boulanger , f. , rubio , m. , hanus , m. , sauvage , m. , tran , d. , bosma , a. , madden , s. , & vigroux , l.  2000 , , 362 , 310 danforth , c.w . , sankrit , r. , blair , w.p . , howk , j.c . & chu , y.h . 2003 , , 586,1179 dolphin , a.e . , walker , a.r . , hodge , p.w . , mateo , m. , olszewski , e.w . , schommer , r.a . & suntzeff , n.b . 2001 , 562 , 303 inoue , h. , koyama , k. , & tanaka , y.  1983 , iau symp .  101 : supernova remnants and their x -

[ fig : sfz ] . the decrease of the variability amplitude with increasing wavelength observed in the present qso sample is consistent with the results obtained for individual objects at low redshift by edelson et al . ( @xcite ) , kinney et al . ( @xcite ) , paltani & courvoisier ( @xcite ) . is this variability - frequency correlation sufficient to account for the positive correlation between redshift and variability found in @xcite ? let us assume a simple power - law representation of a typical qso spectrum ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the flux at an observed wavelength @xmath11 , @xmath12 an arbitrary wavelength and @xmath13 the spectral index . the variability can then be modeled as a change in the spectral index : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a function of time . in this way the flux variations are idealized as changes in the slope of the power - law `` hinged '' on the point of wavelength @xmath16 , that we imagine somewhere redwards of the b and r bands . converting in magnitudes , @xmath17^{\\alpha+\\epsilon(t ) } + c , \\ ] ] we obtain the following expression for the magnitude variations : @xmath18 \\log\\left [ { { \\lambda_0 ( 1+z ) } \\over \\lambda_{\\rm r } } \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      from eq . [ eq : ratio ] we would expect a decreasing ratio @xmath20 with increasing redshift . in the present data we observe , if any , a very small decrement of @xmath20 with the redshift ( from @xmath21 to @xmath22 for two sub - samples with redshift @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively ) . if we turn back to eq . [ eq : dm ] , we can see how this lower limit to @xmath16 , together with the typical observed rms for the variability @xmath28 and @xmath29 of 0.35 and 0.28 mag , respectively ( see fig .  [ fig : sfbr ] ) , puts an upper limit to the rms variation of the spectral index @xmath30 . this value can be compared with the typical dispersion in the spectral indices observed in various qso samples : @xcite have obtained @xmath31 in a control sample of 15 qsos , francis ( 1993 ) observed @xmath32 in a much larger sample , showing also a systematic hardening of the spectrum with increasing redshift . in this way the dispersion in the observed spectral indices of the qso population can be only partially accounted for by variability and significant intrinsic differences between qso and qso have to be invoked ( but see also the dispersion @xmath33 estimated by elvis et al . , 1994 ) . putting in eq . [ eq : dm ] our best estimates for @xmath34 and @xmath35  , we obtain for the typical rms variability in the @xmath36 band @xmath37 and @xmath38 mag at @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively and @xmath41 and @xmath42 in the @xmath43 band at the same redshifts , consistent with the observations of paper i.    the dependence of the variability time scale on the wavelength is a standard prediction of the accretion disk model . the temperature of the disk decreases with the radius , and the dynamical , thermal and viscous time scales all increase as @xmath44 ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , in the standard model , involving instabilities in a thin accretion disk around a supermassive black hole , the intrinsic characteristic time scale should vary as @xmath45 . more in general , if the source is thermal and if the flux variability is due to temperature changes , the observed wavelength dependence can be naturally produced ( paltani & courvoisier @xcite ) . the only requirement concerns the turnover in the spectral energy distribution that should not be located at such a high frequency that the spectral slope in the observed band becomes independent of the temperature ( e.g. the rayleigh - jeans domain for a black body spectrum ) . as remarked by di clemente et al . ( 1996 ) , if brighter objects are on average hotter and the variability is due to temperature changes , one would expect a negative correlation between amplitude of the variability and luminosity , as observed . assuming for example a spectrum of black body or thermal bremsstrahlung , the spectral turnover of brighter objects is progressively shifted at higher frequencies producing progressively smaller flux changes , from @xmath46 for @xmath47 , to @xmath48 for @xmath49 . the broad - band variability in the starburst model ( @xcite and references therein ) is defined by the superposition of a variable component , supernova explosions ( sne ) generating rapidly evolving compact supernova remnants ( csnr ) , and a non - variable component , a young stellar cluster and the other stars of the galaxy . the problem of predicting the wavelength dependence of the variability can be reduced to computing the spectra of the variable and non - variable components , and their relative luminosities . the spectrum of the non - variable component has been predicted to show a @xmath50 with @xmath51 ( @xcite ) . the variable / non - variable relative luminosities can also be estimated on the basis of stellar evolution ( @xcite ) . much more difficult is to predict the optical / uv spectrum of the variable component . it is expected to be harder than the non - variable component with a @xmath50 and @xmath52 . we can model the total qso flux according to a simple poissonian model ( @xcite ) as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the non - variable fraction of the total flux and @xmath55 , @xmath56 are the slopes of the non - variable and variable components . indicating with @xmath57 and @xmath58 the effective wavelengths of the b and r - band and putting for simplicity @xmath59 , we obtain for the ratio between the b - band and r - band variability : @xmath60 with @xmath61 . + for example , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively ( @xcite ) , the ratio between the b - band and r - band variability is expected to be about 1.4 at @xmath64 , tending to 1 for increasing redshift , independent on the intrinsic luminosity of the qso . the above reported slight tendency for a decreasing @xmath20 ratio with increasing redshift is compatible with this model . however , an increase of the @xmath20 with the absolute luminosity is also observed . we find the values @xmath65 and @xmath66 for two subsamples with @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) and @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , respectively . this suggests that more general situations have to be envisaged in which the fraction on the non - variable component and/or the pulse properties ( e.g. the spectral distribution ) depend on the global luminosity of the object . recently hawkins ( @xcite ) has proposed that the variability of nearly all the qsos ( except the very low redshift ones ) is produced by microlensing . a non - achromatic behaviour can be accommodated in this kind of model . for a source comparable in size to the einstein ring of the lens , with a quasar disk redder at larger radii , the bluer compact core would produce a larger amplitude of the variations in the blue passband whereas the larger extent of the red image would cause a small amplitude variation , albeit with a longer duration , in the red . however it can not be denied that achromatic light variations would have been one of the most significant characteristics of the microlensing model and the present observation of the wavelength dependence make it less appealing / compelling . in particular the superposition of the two competing effects of time dilation and correlation of the variability with frequency , i.e. redshift , accounts naturally , also in the accretion disk and in the starburst scenarios , for the observed lack of correlation in the observer s rest frame between the variability time scale and the redshift , otherwise claimed as an evidence in favor of the microlensing model . it is a pleasure to thank i. aretxaga , g. fasano , e. giallongo , m. hawkins , r. terlevich , d. trevese , m. h. ulrich , p. vron and r. vio for enlightening discussions . this research has been partially supported by the asi contracts 94-rs-107 and by antares , an astrophysics network funded by the hcm programme of the european community .

? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . with the commissioning of the multi - band heterodyne receiver , emir , at the iram 30 m telescope , this situation has greatly improved . emir s 8-ghz instantaneous , dual - polarization bandwidth in the 3-mm band provides the same spectral coverage as alma . combined with the large collecting area of the 30 m telescope this allows for blind searches for high - redshift co lines at mm wavelengths .    to demonstrate the capabilities of emir as a ` redshift machine ' , we targeted smmj14009 + 0252 . this source was discovered by the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) in early 1998 and is one of the brightest smgs discovered to date ( @xmath4mjy , * ?

the separation of genuine hints of new physics among complex effects of natural fluctuations becomes more reliable . usually , the gamma ray families recorded with xrec at very high altitudes are not contained events ; the origin of the collision can be only approached by the invariant mass of the @xmath1 s and sometimes by the geometry of the most energetic subcascades . aside from those events which are more or less dependent on the primary composition , the extensive air shower data , through the characteristic properties of the different components is also correlated with the important features of the primary collisions up to energies larger by 3 orders of magnitude ( in laboratory system ) than the present limit of the lhc . additive uncertainties come from the cosmic ray particles interaction with the air nuclei ( n , o , ar ) instead of nucleons , the lower energy limits of the experiments in p - a collisions and a lack of observation in the fragmentation region in colliders . the centauros have been widely studied in the previous isvhecri symposia and measurements are done in colliders in relation with @xmath2 relation . hence , this section is concentrated on other striking features such as the abnormal fluctuations in pseudo rapidity distribution and the coplanar emission . the observation of the pseudo rapidity distribution near an energy above @xmath3 gev is rare ; we may quote the texas lone star , a dozen of a - a collisions recorded in balloons by the jacee and an event recorded in the concorde experiment @xcite exhibiting spikes in the pseudo rapidity distribution ( fig.1 ) . the localisation of the vertex in the cabin wall of the concorde airliner by both triangulation and invariant mass method allowed the reconstruction of this distribution , also plotted in the centre of mass system ( cms ) on fig.2 assuming a primary energy of @xmath3 gev . the forward cone ( 142 @xmath0 s over 149 ) is compared here with the charged inclusive and semi inclusive nsd pseudo rapidity distributions for @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the koba - nielsen - olesen parameter ) averaged over 3000 events generated with our monte carlo generator ( see section 3 ) . s pseudo rapidity distribution in laboratory system for 149 @xmath0 s recorded in the event jf1af1 at concorde flight altitude of @xmath7 km ;

this could explain why the coplanar emission is more likely observed close to @xmath29 gev . such configuration is no more necessary at energies exceeding this threshold , the excitation energy being widely sufficient to generate the valence diquark breaking . there are some super families at energies above the energy of the lhc ( andromeda , tadjikistan , fianit ... ) . those events present halos , multiple clustering , large multiplicities and large @xmath24 , but up to now no coplanar emission . taking the opportunity of the earliest results of the lhc given by cms @xcite , we begin to update and improve the collision generator hdpm implemented in corsika and report here the preliminary results obtained with the non - diffractive code . the parameters of the main guidelines such as the average central pseudo rapidity density @xmath30 , the average multiplicity @xmath31 have been tuned on the experimental data as follows for @xmath32 tev : @xmath33 instead of the previous adjustment to ua5 data : @xmath34 those asympotic tendencies turn to be an intermediate between the behaviour predicted by the landau hydrodynamical model ( having overestimated the conversion in an @xmath35 multiplicity of the major part of the cm s available energy ) and the prediction of feynman s scaling in favour of @xmath36 . our collision monte carlo generator has provided in those conditions the pseudo rapidity distributions @xmath37 for charged and neutral particles , as shown for charged hadrons on fig.5 . the central pseudorapidityies are in agreement with cms , atlas and alice measurements . other characteristics of the p - p collisions are shown in table  [ l2ea4-t1 ] . the inclusive and semi - inclusive data are compared in fig .  2 at @xmath38 tev ( comparison with jf1af1 ) . the discrepancy with earliest extrapolations based on ua5 data are not visible at this energy , but according to table  [ l2ea4-t1 ] we can expect clear asymptotic tendencies such as larger multiplicities , larger violation of kno scaling , larger central rapidity densities and a larger energy flow transferred to secondaries ( as suggested by the inelasticity @xmath39 in table  [ l2ea4-t1 ] ) . the microscopic models with intrinsic parameters tuned to involve those effects will produce for proton initiated showers more muons and a maximum depth of the e.m . component at higher altitude . consequently , the present values proposed for the primary mass are overestimated in the knee region and beyond . .characteristics of nsd inclusive data [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ l2ea4-t1 ]      at ultra high energy , the maximum depth @xmath40 is also an indicator of the characteristics of the primary interaction in reason of the relation of the individual maximum of the main subcascade with two factors ; the vertex of the earliest collisions dependent on the inelastic cross section on one hand , the individual energy given to the most energetic @xmath0 s according to the profile of the fragmentation region on the other hand . the situation is compared on fig.5 with the different models @xcite together with the data collected by hires and auger . in contrast with hires , above an energy of @xmath41 eev , auger suggests that the penetration power of cosmic particle in atmosphere levels off with an asymptotic tendency pointing to the alone event and most energetic event of the fly s eye . is here a hint of a phase transition to qgp ( an energy density larger than @xmath42 gev / fm@xmath43 can be expected for 100 eev collisions ) ? is it the signature of a transition to a heavy primary composition ? we observe that the last bins of energy in fig.6 for auger contains hardly 20 primaries and the hybrid showers selected by the surface detector might not reflect the actual situation of the primary flux in those bins . the preliminary data coming from the lhc implies at least an incremental revision of the models used in eas simulation . the interpretation of the simulations will turn consequently to lower the primary mass composition at the knee level and above . the modest changes expected up to @xmath44 gev could be more important at auger level and would favour the interpretation of hires ( gzk behaviour and pure proton component ) .    in the lhc energy range , the conjecture is similar to the situation preceding the discovery of the charm , proposed in cosmic rays , rejected in a first accelerator experiment and finally discovered in further measurements . furthermore lhc data will help to clarify the role of complex fluctuations in xrec data : updated xrec experiments ( for instance with emulsion bricks ) could also be performed in parallel with the lhc in order to determine the behaviour of the most energetic secondaries in fragmentation region .    9 j.n . capdevielle et al . , proc.19th icrc , 6 , 127 , kyoto ( 1979 ) , nuovo cimento 69 , 295 ( 1982 ) , nucl . b , 75a , 12 ( 1999 ) a. faessler , proc . nucleus - nucleus collisions int . conf . , ( michigan , 1982 ) , nuclear physics a400 , 578c ( 1983 ) ua5 a general study of proton - antiproton physics at @xmath45gev , g. j. alner et al . , physics reports , 154 , 247 ( 1987 ) j.n . capdevielle , r. attallah and m.c . talai , j. phys . g , 31 , 373 - 388 ( 2005 ) ;

objects with successively higher masses assemble later ( cf . haiman , thoul , & loeb and references therein ) . such objects are the most natural sites for the formation of the first generation of stars . although it is not known how star  formation in these objects proceeds , a necessary requirement for continued post  virialization collapse and fragmentation is that the gas can cool efficiently . in the metal  poor primordial gas , the only coolants available are neutral atomic hydrogen ( h ) and molecular hydrogen ( @xmath10 ) . however , it has been found ( haiman , rees , & loeb 1996 , 1997 ; gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) that the @xmath11 molecules are fragile , and are photodissociated throughout the universe . accordingly , we assume that clouds form stars if and only if they are massive enough to cool via atomic h transition lines ( @xmath12k ) . the total number of stars formed can be fixed using the recent observations ( songaila & cowie 1996 , tytler et al . 1995 ) of the near universal carbon to hydrogen ( c / h ) ratio in lyman@xmath13 forest clouds at redshifts as high as @xmath1 . these observations yield the value c / h @xmath5 1% solar for systems with a large range of column  densities . the fact that ( i ) the scatter in the metalicity from one system to another is only an order of magnitude , and ( ii ) the overdensity of the lowest column density system is only a few ( i.e. , too tenuous to form its own stars ) supports the hypothesis of uniform metal enrichment by an early generation of stars . based on this star  formation efficiency , the redshift evolution of the abundance of star  forming clouds , and a detailed composite model spectrum for a low  metalicity stellar population with the local scalo ( 1986 ) initial mass function ( imf ) , we derive the expected number  flux relation and angular size distribution of these star clusters . we find that ngst would be able to image more than @xmath2 of these star clusters at @xmath3 within its @xmath4 field of view , with @xmath51% of these clusters possibly resolved . in addition , we show that the pre  galactic population of stars reionize the universe by a redshift of @xmath14 . the consequent damping of microwave anisotropies on small angular scales is @xmath15% , detectable on @xmath6 angular scales by map and planck . galactic low  mass stars could also account for some of the microlensing events observed in the halo of the milky way ( alcock et al . 1997 ) , and could also be detected in the future through their lensing of distant quasars ( gould 1995 ) . to quantify the observational signatures of the first stars in cdm cosmologies , we use a simple semi  analytic approach that is complimentary to more detailed , but computationally expensive and therefore less versatile , 3d numerical simulations ( e.g. gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) . the main ingredients of our model are :    we use the press  schechter formalism to find the abundance and mass distribution of virialized dark matter halos . since initially most of the collapsed baryons are in low  mass systems near the jeans mass , the pressure of the baryons has a significant effect on the collapsed fraction . effectively , the collapse of the baryons is delayed relative to the dark matter in these low  mass objects ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ) . we obtained the exact collapse redshifts of spherically symmetric perturbations by following the motion of both the baryonic and the dark matter shells with a one dimensional hydrodynamics code ( haiman & loeb 1997 ) . we find that because of shell  crossing with the cold dark matter , baryonic objects with masses @xmath16 , well below the linear  regime jeans mass , are able to collapse by @xmath17@xmath5@xmath18 . another important effect is the feedback on the collapsed fraction from the photoionization of the igm . as the first stars form , they ionize a fraction @xmath19 of the gas in the universe . in these regions condensation of objects is strongly suppressed ; to be conservative we assume that only a fraction ( @xmath20 ) of the gas participates in forming new virialized objects . we calibrate the fraction @xmath21 of the condensed gas converted into stars in each virialized cloud using the inferred c / h ratio in the  absorption forest . we use tabulated @xmath22c yields of stars with various masses , and consider three different initial mass functions ( imfs ) . the uncertainty in the total carbon production is a factor of @xmath510 ; a factor of @xmath53 is from the uncertainty in the carbon yields of @xmath23 stars due to the unknown extent of hot bottom burning ( renzini & voli 1981 ) , and another factor of @xmath53 is due to the difference between the scalo and miller  scalo ( 1979 ) imfs . to be conservative , we assume inefficient hot bottom burning , i.e. maximum carbon yields . under these assumptions , we find @xmath24 . is @xmath550% , the fraction of all baryons in stars is @xmath56% . a factor of @xmath53 is included in this number due to the average time required to produce carbon inside the stars ; i.e. only a third of the total stellar carbon is produced by @xmath1 . ] we also include a negative feedback on star  formation due to the photodissociation of molecular hydrogen by photons with energies in the range @xmath25@xmath26 ev . these photons are not absorbed by neutral h and travel freely across the igm . we find ( haiman , rees & loeb 1997 ) that the masses required to self - shield @xmath11 against photodissociation by the solomon process ( cf . field , somerville & dressler 1966 ) are exceedingly high ( @xmath27 for a spherical object with an overdensity of 200 at @xmath28 ) . as a result , soon after the appearance of the first few stars , @xmath11 is universally destroyed , and molecular cooling is suppressed even inside dense objects . due to the lack of any other cooling agent in the metal  poor primordial gas , the bulk of the pre  galactic stars must form via atomic line cooling inside massive clouds with virial temperatures of at least @xmath29k , or @xmath30^{-3/2 } { \\rm m_{\\odot}}$ ] . we therefore allow star  formation only inside clouds with at least this mass .    to determine the ionization history of the universe , we need to follow the evolution of the ionization ( strmgren ) front around each star cluster . the composite spectrum of radiation which emerges from each star cluster is determined by the stellar imf and the recombination rate inside the cluster . we follow the time - dependent spectrum of a star of a given mass based on standard spectral atlases ( kurucz 1993 ) and the evolution of the star on the h  r diagram as prescribed by theoretical evolutionary tracks ( schaller et al . 1992 ) .    to calculate the fraction of the ionizing photons lost to recombinations inside their parent cloud , we adopt the equilibrium @xmath31 density profile of gas inside each cloud according to our spherically  symmetric simulations ( haiman , thoul & loeb 1996 ) . we assume that stars are distributed with the same @xmath31 profile across the cloud , and obtain the number of recombinations under the assumption of ionization equilibrium . we then use the time  dependent composite luminosity of each star  forming region to calculate the propagation of a spherical ionization front into the surrounding homogeneous igm . the ionized fraction of the universe is given by the volume  filling factor @xmath19 of the ionized bubbles , and the universe is reionized when these bubbles overlap so that @xmath32 . figure  1 shows the predicted number of high  redshift star  clusters at @xmath3 and @xmath7 , per logarithmic flux interval , in the wavelength range of 13.5@xmath33 m . the number of clusters that could be probed by future space telescopes depends on their sensitivity ;

however , the early star clusters may behave differently and form stars at their outskirts , since they are denser , and we have imposed the requirement of efficient atomic line cooling throughout the cloud . with its proposed 0.06 angular resolution , ngst could resolve @xmath5100 virialized star  clusters at @xmath3 , and @xmath38 clusters at @xmath7 per field of view . table 1 summarizes the reionization redshifts and resulting electron scattering optical depths that we obtain in our models for a range of parameters . we varied the cosmological power spectrum ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , the baryon density ( @xmath41 ) , the star formation efficiency ( @xmath21 ) , the escape fraction of ionizing photons ( @xmath42 ) , the imf , and whether or not the negative feedback due to @xmath11 is included . for almost the entire range of parameters , the universe is reionized by a redshift @xmath43 . the only exception occurs when the imf is strongly tilted towards low  mass stars . we considered an unconventional tilt of this kind by adding a constant 1.7 to the power  law index , while keeping the imf fixed at @xmath44 . with this tilt , the increased number of low  mass stars could account for the observed microlensing events . in this case , however , reionization is strongly suppressed due to the absence of massive stars which ordinarily dominate the ionizing flux . the redshift evolution of the ionized fraction @xmath19 can be directly converted into the optical depth @xmath45 to electron scattering to high redshifts . for the range of parameters in table  1 , we find @xmath46@xmath47 . the corresponding damping factor for the cmb anisotropies ( hu & white 1997 ) is @xmath48@xmath49 . such a damping could be detected by the map and planck satellites , especially if the polarization of the cmb is measured ( zaldarriaga 1996 ) . alcock , c. , et al . 1997 , apj , 479 , 119 gould , a. 1995 , apj , 455 , 37 gnedin , n. y. , ostriker , j. p. , 1997 , apj , in press , astro - ph/9612127 field , g. b. , somerville , w. b. , and dressler , k. 1966 , ara&a 4 , 207 haiman , z. , thoul , a. , & loeb , a. 1996 , apj , 464 , 523 haiman , z. , rees , m. j. , & loeb , a. 1996 , apj , 467 , 522 haiman , z. , rees , m. j. , & loeb , a. 1997 , apj , 476 , 458 haiman , z. , & loeb , a. 1997 , apj , in press , astro - ph/9611028 hu , w. , & white , m. 1997 , apj , 479 , 568 kurucz , r. 1993 , cd - rom no . 13 , atlas9 stellar atmosphere programs miller , g. e. , & scalo , j. m. 1979 , apjs , 41 , 513 renzini , a. , & voli , m. 1981 , a&a , 94 , 175 scalo , j. m. 1986 , fundamentals of cosmic physics , vol . 11 , p. 1 - 278 schaller , g. , schaerer , d. , meynet , g. , & maeder , a. 1992 , a&ass , 96 , 269 songaila , a. , & cowie , l. l. 1996 aj , 112 , 335 tytler , d. et al . 1995 , in qso absorption lines , eso astrophysics symposia , ed . g. meylan ( heidelberg : springer ) , p.289 zaldarriaga , m. 1996 , preprint astro - ph/9608050 "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " we calculate the observable signatures of the first generation of stars at high redshift ( @xmath0 ) . to determine the cosmic star    formation history , we use an extension of the press    schechter formalism for cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmologies that incorporates gas pressure .   we calibrate the fraction of gas converted into stars to be 6% so as to reproduce the 1% solar c / h ratio observed in the intergalactic medium ( igm ) at @xmath1 .    with this star    formation efficiency , we find that ngst would be able to image more than @xmath2 star clusters from high redshifts ( @xmath3 ) within its @xmath4 field of view . if stars occupy a region comparable to the virial radius of the cluster , then @xmath51% of these clusters could be resolved .   we calculate the expected number  flux relation and angular size distribution for these early star clusters .   we also describe the reionization of the igm due to the first generation of stars , and the consequent damping of the cmb anisotropies on small angular scales .   this damping could be detected on @xmath6 angular scales by map and planck .

thermal high - energy photon production , via leptonic and/or hadronic process after acceleration of primary particles in the collision shock @xcite . this possibility is substantiated by the detection of ( non - thermal ) synchrotron radio - emission from the expected colliding wind location in some binaries ( see below ) . many models have been proposed to predict gev to tev emission from these binaries , with different levels of detail @xcite . conceptually , the process would mimic the cases of ls5039 @xcite , psrb1259 - 63 @xcite or lsi+61303 @xcite , particularly if they result in pulsar - driven @xmath4-ray binaries in which @xmath4-rays may arise from a shock region produced by the interaction of the winds of the two components .    in a recent paper , the high energy stereoscopic array ( h.e.s.s . ) collaboration reported the discovery of very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath4-ray emission coincident with the young stellar cluster westerlund2 @xcite . the high energy gamma ray astronomy ( hegra ) and the major atmospheric gamma imaging cherenkov ( magic ) telescope detected the source tevj2032 + 4130 and suggested a possible connection with the cygnus ob2 cluster @xcite . theoretically , the relationship between stellar associations and high - energy emission has been put forward by many authors , since early - type stellar associations have long been proposed as cosmic - ray acceleration sites and also as providers of target material for cosmic - ray interactions @xcite .    in the case of cygnusob2 , the vhe emission is supposed to occur at a region displaced from the center of the association , where detailed multiwavelength studies revealed an overdensity of hot ob stars , although not wrs @xcite . in the case of westerlund2 , the stellar cluster contains at least a dozen early - type o - stars , and two remarkable wr stars , wr20a and wr20b . in particular , wr20a was recently established to be a binary @xcite . based on the orbital period , the minimum masses were found to be around @xmath5@xmath6 and @xmath7@xmath6 for the binary components @xcite , what certainly qualifies it among the most massive binary systems in our galaxy . no significant flux variability or orbital periodicity was found in the corresponding data sets , neither for the cygnusob2 nor for the westerlund2 regions . unless such an orbital period is detected in future datasets , it would be very difficult or impossible for the current generation of instruments to distinguish whether the radiation observed from these associations is coming from a isolated binary system or rather is generated as a collective effect of the whole cluster . thus , a direct measurement of single wr binary systems , to explore whether they are able to produce high - energy @xmath4-ray emission in an isolated condition , is worth pursuing . after briefly motivating the scenario for @xmath4-ray emission from isolated binary systems , we present the results of magic observations of two such systems . for the present investigation , and apart from other technical considerations like a favorable declination , we looked for candidates with non - thermal emission , indicating the presence of relativistic electrons , and for which the geometry of the colliding wind region is established . the two selected systems wr146 and wr147 have been resolved using the very large array ( vla ) and the multi - element radio linked interferometer ( merlin ) in two sources each and at least for wr147 , where the most detailed model is currently available , the system was predicted to be a powerful magic source for most of the orbital period @xcite .    for the angular resolution of the magic telescope ( @xmath8 ) the colliding wind zone will not appear to be spatially resolved , presenting individual colliding wind binary systems as point - source candidates at the @xmath4-ray sky . thus we have searched for point sources in the direction of these two binaries @xcite . wr147 @xcite , among the closest and brightest systems that show non - thermal radio emission in the cm band , is composed of a wn8(h ) plus a b0.5v star with a bolometric luminosity of @xmath9 and effective temperature @xmath10k , i.e. thermal photon energy of about @xmath11ev . at a distance of 650pc the implied binary separation is estimated to be 417au . the mass loss rates ( @xmath12/yr , @xmath13/yr ) and wind velocities ( @xmath14km / s , @xmath15km / s ) place the stagnation point at @xmath16 cm . this is in fact in agreement with merlin observations , which show a northern non - thermal component and a southern thermal one with a separation of ( @xmath17)mas @xcite . this radio morphology and spectrum support a colliding wind scenario @xcite , whose collision region has also been detected by the chandra x - ray telescope @xcite . the non - thermal flux component can be well fitted by a power law with spectral index @xmath18 . neither the eccentricity nor the inclination of the system are known due to the very long orbital period @xcite . reimer @xcite have provided a detailed modeling of the high - energy @xmath4-ray emission expected from wr147 . the expected fluxes are shown in figure  [ fig : wr147 ] , together with magic upper limits for which we give further details below . wr147 was observed with the magic telescope between 11 august and 10 september 2007 , for a total of 30.3 hours of good data ( after quality cuts removing bad weather runs ) . the zenith angle of the observations ranged between 10@xmath19 and 30@xmath19 , being sensitive to gamma - rays in the energy range between about 80gev and 10tev . the observations were carried out in the false - source track ( wobble ) mode @xcite , with two directions at @xmath20 distance east - west of the source direction . the analysis of the data was performed with the magic standard analysis chain @xcite , which combines hillas image parameters by means of a random forest algorithm @xcite for signal / background discrimination and energy estimation . the training of the algorithm is done by means of contemporary data from the crab nebula observations and monte carlo simulated gamma - ray events . since february 2007 , magic signal digitization has been upgraded to 2gsample / s flash analog - to - digital coverters ( fadcs ) , and timing parameters are used during the data analysis  @xcite . this results in an improvement of the flux sensitivity from 2.5@xmath21 to 1.6@xmath21 ( at a flux peak energy of 280gev ) of the crab nebula flux in 50 hours of observations . deg , from @xcite . @xmath22 pair production absorbs not more than @xmath230.3% ( @xmath24gev ) and @xmath2318% ( @xmath25gev ) of the produced flux at orbital phases 0.25 and 0.5 , respectively . no absorption takes place at phase 0 . magic upper limits on this system are marked . , width=302 ]    .wr147 observation results [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]     searches of gamma - rays from wr147 have been performed for three different energy cuts , namely : above 80gev , above 200gev and above 600gev . in all cases the number of signal candidate events found are compatible with statistical fluctuations of the expected background . the obtained upper limits are shown in table  [ tab : wr147 ] and figure  [ fig : wr147 ] , and correspond to 1.5@xmath21 , 1.4@xmath21 and 1.7@xmath21 of the crab nebula flux for the three considered energy bins , respectively . wr146 is a similar system : a wc6+o8 colliding - wind binary system also presenting thermal emission from the stellar winds of the two stars , and bright non - thermal emission from the wind - collision region @xcite . the period is estimated to be @xmath26 300yr @xcite and the estimates of the distance to the system differ from 0.75kpc to 1.7kpc @xcite . wr146 is located @xmath27 away from the unidentified vhe @xmath4-ray source tev j2032 + 4130 and was observed with magic within the observation program devoted to this source @xcite , albeit with a reduced sensitivity . the total effective exposure , which accounts for the loss of sensitivity of off - axis observations and camera illumination during moonlight observations @xcite , is 44.5 hours , obtained between 2005 and 2007 . at magic site , wr146 culminates at 14@xmath19 and the observations were carried out at zenith angles between 14@xmath19 and 44@xmath19 @xcite . the data analysis follows the standard magic analysis chain . since most of the data are acquired with 300 mhz fadcs , image timing parameters are not used in this analysis .    the result of the searches of gamma - rays from wr146 for three different energy cuts ( above 80gev , above 200gev and @xmath28600gev ) are shown in table  [ tab : wr146 ] . as for the case of wr147 , all measured signal candidates are consistent with background fluctuations and the upper limits ( corresponding to @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the crab nebula flux ) are presented . at the lower energy bins we see a positive number of excesses at the @xmath32 level . however , the present data are too scarce to establish if this comes from a gamma - ray signal or background fluctuations . future observations will shed light on this issue . our search for vhe @xmath4-ray emission from two archetypical cases of wr binaries produced the first bounds on such systems . these bounds constrain theoretical models ( or , assuming correctness of the models , their internal parameters , such as the -unknown- orbital phases of the systems ) . the establishment of wr binaries as vhe @xmath4-ray sources is yet pending . the case for wr147 as a potential @xmath4-ray source for magic was theoretically established before , as shown in the corresponding curves of figure  [ fig : wr147 ] from @xcite , for most of the orbital phases . the validity of this model is baselined on an assumed ensemble of orbital parameters , which are still unknown for this system . for instance , ignorance of its current phase as well as of its eccentricity and inclination makes a direct ruling out of this model impossible , although that the presented scenario could nominally survive only for phases close to 0 , defined where the line of sight encounters first with the wn8 and then the b0.5v star . the magic observations show that irrespective of phase , glast should see a flux cutoff well within its range of detectability in the tens of gev regime , if it is able to detect the stars at all . _ we acknowledge a. reimer for providing us the theoretical curves depicted in figure 1 . we also would like to thank the instituto de astrofisica de canarias for the excellent working conditions at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos in la palma . the support of the german bmbf and mpg , the italian infn and spanish cicyt is gratefully acknowledged . this work was also supported by eth research grant th 34/043 , by the polish mniszw grant n n203 390834 , and by the yip of the helmholtz gemeinschaft . _      aharonian , f. et al . 2002 , a&a 393 , l37 aharonian , f. et al . 2005 , a&a 431 , 197 aharonian , f. , et al . 2005 , a&a 442 , 1 aharonian , f. , et al . 2006 , a&a 460 , 743 aharonian , f. et al . 2007 , a&a 467 , 1075 albert , j. et al . 2006 , science 312 , 1771 albert , j. , et al . 2007 , astro -

( 1.1 ) gives the probability per unit volume and per unit time , that a pair is produced , while the transport equation requires the source term in _ one - particle phase space_. finally , and more importantly , unlike the case considered in @xcite where the constant electric field is maintained by external sources , the pairs produced in the background - field models derive their energy and momentum from the field , the field becomes time dependent and eq . ( 1.1 ) stops being applicable . the resolution of these problems has so far involved rewriting the right - hand side of eq . ( 1.1 ) as an integral over @xmath4 or @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the parton momentum transverse to the direction of the collision axis . the expression so obtained has often been used in the qgp transport equation and it reads @xcite @xmath7 \\right\\vert.\\ ] ] while the above extension may be justified semiclassically , the next assumption that the constant @xmath0 in eq . ( 1.2 ) , may be replaced by its time - dependent counterpart @xmath8 , merits a critical examination . strictly speaking , this replacement is invalid since as soon as the field acquires time dependence , it can directly excite negative - energy particles to levels above the mass gap , by a perturbative mechanism , without recourse to any tunneling or barrier penetration mechanism . the above replacement may be justified as a kind of a local - field approximation provided the time - dependence of @xmath8 is so weak that it only excites frequencies with magnitudes negligible compared to the mass gap . equivalently , the field needs to be constant on the scale of the compton wavelength @xmath9 . fields that are constant over such large time intervals are unlikely to be produced in heavy - ion collisions . moreover , a justification for the local - field approximation , which could be looked for _ a posteriori _ is not forthcoming from the explicit numerical results presented in @xcite . the purpose of this paper is to take the time dependence of the electric field into account , as properly as a semiclassical formalism would allow , and present a new source term based on fig . 1b , for use in the qgp transport equation , thereby avoiding the unphysical aspect that we have pointed out in the current formulation . the mechanism depicted in fig . 1b was used by martin et al . @xcite to calculate the total energy deposited during a certain time interval , under certain assumptions . they did not derive a source term . for fermion pair production in the presence of a _ space - time - dependent _ background field the amplitude to the lowest order ( fig . 1b ) is given by @xmath10 and the probability for pair production is @xmath11 where @xmath12.\\ ] ] since our aim is to obtain the production rate in the one - particle phase space , for insertion in the boltzmann equation for a one - particle distribution function @xmath13 , we choose to perform the @xmath14-integration first . next , in order to evaluate @xmath15 , we introduce @xmath16 and use @xmath17 . this gives @xmath18 now recall @xmath19 to be able to compare our results with those based on eq . ( 1.2 ) , we ignore the magnetic field @xmath20 . note also that pair production is an electric effect @xcite . equations ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.4 ) give us @xmath21    note that the remaining term @xmath22 in eq .

( this gauge choice is natural in the colour - plates model where @xmath33 is taken along the collision or @xmath29-axis . ) equation ( 2.6 ) ensures the gauge condition @xmath34 . we have @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the dual of @xmath37 .    keeping in mind the boost - invariant central - rapidity region expected to be formed in ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions , we assume that the electric field @xmath38 depends only on the boost - invariant variable @xmath39 . hence @xmath40~ { \\bf e}(\\tau).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows that @xmath41 and hence the two particles have identical transverse mass , say @xmath42 . the relevant components of their 4-momenta are    [ generallabel ] @xmath43 such that @xmath44    where @xmath45 are their rapidities . for a future reference we note the following results @xmath46.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now in order to rewrite @xmath22 in terms of @xmath25 , we use eqs .

( 2.13 ) and ( 2.14 ) we get the desired expression @xmath50 the occurrence of @xmath51 in the denominator is noteworthy . it indicates a highly nonlocal nature of this term in the configuration space ; the production rate depends not only on the instantaneous strength of the field but also on its derivatives . _ this feature is absent in eq . _ substituting @xmath52 from eq . ( 2.12 ) in eq . ( 2.15 ) and then substituting the resulting expression in eq . ( 2.5 ) we get @xmath53 thus the probability @xmath54 in eq . ( 2.1 ) becomes @xmath55    in order to evaluate @xmath25 occurring in eq . ( 2.16 ) we define ( for @xmath56 ) @xmath57 and substitute @xmath58 in eq .

( 2.18 ) . substituting @xmath60 given in eq . ( 2.18 ) in eq . ( 2.17 ) and performing the @xmath63-integration by parts , we get @xmath64 the @xmath65-integration too can be done analytically @xcite which gives @xmath66 where @xmath67    we continue with our derivation of @xmath54 by substituting @xmath68 from eq .

( 2.15 ) and the comment made thereafter . in order to recover the dependence of @xmath54 on the instantaneous strength of the field @xmath71 and to obtain a time - dependent rate , we shall employ the integral representation : @xmath72 equations ( 2.19)-(2.22 ) together with eq . ( 2.16 ) yield @xmath73 note that @xmath74 the integration over @xmath75 can be done trivially with the help of the delta function @xmath76 in order to obtain the production rate in the one - particle phase space we follow the literature and assume as in ref . @xcite that if a particle is produced at @xmath29 and @xmath28 , it must appear with the longitudinal velocity @xmath77 . ( this is reminiscent of the thomas - fermi approximation in condensed - matter physics . ) it allows us to identify the spatial and momentum rapidities and we can write @xmath78    combining these results we finally get the new source term : @xmath79 where the electric field @xmath60 and the function @xmath80 are defined in eqs . ( 2.18 ) and ( 2.20 ) , respectively , and from eq . ( 2.12 ) the invariant mass of the pair , @xmath81 , is given by @xmath82 we now compare the old and the new source terms given in eqs . ( 1.2 ) and ( 2.23 ) , respectively . both are invariant under lorentz boosts in the longitudinal or @xmath29 direction . in the limit @xmath83 , ( 1.2 ) and all of its derivatives vanish , while ( 2.23 ) behaves like @xmath84 . in the large @xmath0 limit , ( 1.2 ) behaves like @xmath85 , while ( 2.23 ) behaves like @xmath84 . thus the ratio of the new and the old source terms increases with the strength of the electric field . the transverse - momentum ( @xmath86 ) dependence arises naturally in the derivation of eq . the longitudinal - momentum dependence too can be recovered , if necessary . we also studied these two terms numerically as a function of the proper time @xmath63 and the transverse momentum @xmath86 , for various values of the input parameters , namely the particle mass @xmath3 , the parameter @xmath61 appearing in eq . ( 2.18 ) , the fine - structure constant @xmath87 , and the initial strength of the electric field @xmath88 . some representative results are shown in figs . ( 2)-(4 ) , where we have taken @xmath89 mev , @xmath90 fm , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 gev/@xmath93 . significant differences are evident .    in view of the above comments and the numerical results presented here , the two source terms , eqs . ( 1.2 ) and ( 2.23 ) , when substituted in the boltzmann equation are expected to contribute differently to the formation of the quark - gluon plasma . it is straightforward to extend eq .

( [ pressuremax ] ) ( maximization procedure ) and ( [ pressurefeyn ] ) ( feynman parametrization ) , as a function of the coupling @xmath3 , for @xmath49 and @xmath50 . in this paper we have considered the effects of the resummation in the study of the infrared behavior of the pressure in the @xmath0 scalar theory in 6 dimensions . for that purpose we have used the mscr , which resums higher - order terms in a nonperturbative fashion . the computation of the scalar self - energy has been done both using a maximization procedure proposed by almeida and frenkel as well as the feynman parametrization . we found that the two approximations agree in the limits analyzed , giving confidence in the procedure we used . we have shown that only one recalculation of the self - energy , which is equivalent to a sum of an infinite subset of diagrams , is enough to ensure the finiteness of the pressure . although the results for the self - energy and the pressure given by the two approximations used differ a little bit from each other , they ensue a finite expression for these quantities in the infrared limit . we note that other approaches like the 2pi  @xcite and the 2ppi  @xcite ( one of its variations ) effective actions are also used to perform systematic selective resummations and furnish nonperturbative results such as the mscr . for some models recently studied in the literature , and under certain approximations , we could point out some similarities between the mscr and , for instance , the 2pi results . consider , for example , the 2pi effective potential at finite temperature for the @xmath52 model , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the dressed propagator . after minimizing @xmath53 with respect to @xmath54 one obtains a gap equation for @xmath54 . if a hartree form is taken for the dressed propagator  @xcite , @xmath55 , this yields an equation for the effective mass , which is eq . ( [ eq4 - 2 ] ) with @xmath56 in this case , where @xmath57 is the bubble diagram  @xcite . however , the 2pi effective resums only the two - point correlation function , leaving the vertex as the bare one leading to gauge dependent results for physical quantities . the gauge dependence of the effective action has been studied by arrizabalaga and smit  @xcite , whereas gauge independent formalisms have been discussed by carrington et . al  @xcite and j. berges  @xcite . a modified form of the 2pi effective action has been suggested by mottola  @xcite in order to maintain gauge invariance in qed . since with the mscr the vertex can be resummed in the same spirit of the two - point functions , it is expected to preserve gauge invariance as well  @xcite . then we conclude that mscr could serve as an alternative nonperturbative method to calculate the pressure and other physical quantities besides a dyson resummation . h. c. would like to thank prof . josif frenkel for the correspondence on the subject and for enlightening discussions . h. c. acknowledges full support of the brazilian agency cnpq . = # 1ann . phys . * # 1 * # 1phys . rep . * # 1 * # 1act . phys . pol . * # 1 * # 1prog . theor . phys . * # 1 * # 1phys . rev . * # 1 * # 1phys . rev . * d # 1 * # 1phys . * c # 1 * # 1phys . . lett . * # 1 * # 1phys . lett . * # 1 * # 1rev . mod . phys.*#1 * # 1nucl . # 1 * # 1z . phys . * # 1 * # 1nuovo cimento * # 1 * # 1sov . . phys . * # 1 *    j. kapusta , _ finite - temperature field theory _ ( cambridge university press , cambridge , 1989 ) . linde , , 289 ( 1980 ) . a.p . de almeida and j. frenkel , , 640 ( 1993 ) . i.t . drummond , r.r . hogan , p.v . landshoff , and a. rebhan , , 326 ( 1997 ) , hep - th/9610189 . carrington , t.j . hammond and r. kobes , , 067703 ( 2002 ) , hep - ph/0111293 . caldas , a.l . mota , and m.c . nemes , , 56011 ( 2001 ) , hep - ph/0005180 . caldas , , 503 ( 2002 ) , hep - ph/0101283 . caldas , , 65005 ( 2002 ) , hep - th/0111194 . caldas , , 105015 , ( 2002 ) , hep - ph/0205267 . h. van hees and j. knoll , , 025010 ( 2002 ) , hep - ph/0107200 . cornwall , r. jackiw , and e. tomboulis , , 2428 ( 1974 ) . h. verschelde and m. coppens , , 133 ( 1992 ) . g. amelino - camelia and s. pi , , 2356 ( 1993 ) , hep - ph/9211211 . nicholas petropoulos , hep - ph/0402136 . a. arrizabalaga and j. smit , , 065014 ( 2002 ) , hep - ph/0207044 . carrington , g. kunstatter and h. zarakest , hep - ph/0309084 . j. berges , hep - ph/0401172 . e. mottola , proceedings of sewm 2002 , world scientific publishing ( 2003 ) , hep - ph/0304279 . h. caldas and a.l . mota , work in progress .

world phenomena like pedestrian dynamics @xcite , traffic flow @xcite , urban growth @xcite , etc . in most cases , the update rule and neighborhood for ca are determined by human experts that have knowledge of the modeled phenomenon . automatic identification of ca - based models remains an open research issue . several attempts have been made in the literature to develop algorithms for ca identification . however , most of the previous research did not investigate the use of real - world data sets as an input . the available algorithms were designed and tested mainly against synthetic data obtained from ca evolution . the use of real - world data for identification of ca models poses additional challenges due to inherent complexity of modeled phenomena and errors that are made during data acquisition . this paper discusses the possibility of using data mining techniques based on the rough sets theory @xcite to select neighborhood and determine rules for ca models . according to the proposed approach , input data describing observed states of cells are represented in form of a decision table . neighborhood is detected by using algorithms for reducts calculation . cells that do not belong to the neighborhood are removed from the decision table . after that , a rule - learning method is applied to induce a set of decision rules that define the evolution of ca . this approach was tested in identification of both deterministic and probabilistic ca models for synthetic as well as real - world data sets . most of the works related to the ca identification problem use genetic algorithms as a tool to extract update rule and neighborhood from spatio - temporal patterns produced in ca evolution @xcite . in @xcite a genetic algorithm was employed to learn probabilistic rules directly from experimental data for two - dimensional binary - state ca . several methods were proposed that use genetic algorithms to learn ca rules and neighborhood size for image processing tasks @xcite . although application of genetic algorithms was a dominant approach to ca identification , some non - genetic techniques are also available . adamatzky @xcite proposed several approaches to extracting rules for different classes of ca . straatman et al . @xcite developed a form of hill climbing and backtracking to identify ca rules . in @xcite a  deterministic sequential floating forward search method was used to select rules of ca . another approach is based on parameter estimation methods from the field of system identification @xcite . a framework for solving the identification problems for both deterministic and probabilistic ca was presented in @xcite . main drawbacks of the existing ca identification methods are related to the fact that they were either designed for a particular class of ca , or their experimental evaluation was limited to the case of synthetic data . the introductory research results presented in this paper shows that the rough sets approach may be effectively used to develop a universal method for identification of ca models that mimic real - world phenomena . formally , a cellular automaton can be defined as a triple @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a non - empty set of cell states , @xmath2 is the neighbourhood , and @xmath3 is the update rule . arguments of @xmath3 are the current states of cells in the neighbourhood , while the value of @xmath3 indicates the state of a central cell at the next time step . the problem of ca identification involves finding both the cells neighborhood and the update rule on the basis of a training data set , which includes observed states of the cells . in order to use the rough sets approach for solving this problem , the training set of data has to be represented in the form of a decision table @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a non - empty set of observations and @xmath6 is a set of cell states : @xmath7 . state of @xmath8-th cell at time step @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 . index @xmath11 indicates the central cell , for which neighborhood and update rule have to be found . thus , the cell state @xmath12 is used as the decision attribute . the remaining cell states @xmath13 are condition attributes . the candidate neighbors @xmath14 are the cells for which distance to the central cell @xmath11 is lower than a threshold value . the threshold is determined experimentally . above definition can be easily extended to multidimensional ca by adding the necessary indexes . neighborhood for the @xmath11-th cell can be selected by calculating reducts of the above - defined decision table . a reduct is a subset of the condition attributes , which is sufficient to determine the decision attributes @xcite . taking into account the decision table discussed above , reduct should be defined as a subset of cell states @xmath15 , which preserves discernibility of the observations with regard to the decision @xmath12 , and none of its proper subsets has this ability . observations are discernible if they differ in at least one condition attribute ( cell state ) . each two observations that have different decisions @xmath12 and are discernible by the full set of cell states @xmath16 are also discernible by the reduct @xmath17 .    the neighborhood @xmath2 of a cell is determined as a set of cells , whose states belongs to the reduct @xmath18 , where @xmath8 is a cell index . there may exist multiple reducts for one decision table . selection of the neighborhood is made with regard to the shortest reduct , because size of the neighborhood has to be minimized . if there are several minimal reducts then the one is selected which has the lowest average distance between neighbors and the central cell . when the reduct @xmath17 is found , the condition attributes that do not belong to this reduct are excluded from the decision table . thus , the modified decision table @xmath19 has the following set of attributes : @xmath20 , where @xmath12 remains the decision attribute .    update rule of a cellular automaton is identified as a set of decision rules by taking into account the information from the modified decision table @xmath21 . a particular decision rule @xmath22 has the following form :    @xmath23    where : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath1 denotes the set of allowable cell states . two characteristics of decision rules are useful for the proposed method : support and match @xcite . support of rule @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath26 , is equal to the number of observations from @xmath21 for which rule @xmath22 applies correctly , i.e. , premise of the rule is satisfied and the decision given by rule is consistent with the one in decision table . @xmath27 is the number of observations in @xmath21 for which the rule @xmath22 applies , i.e. , premise of the rule is satisfied . based on these two characteristics , a certainty factor is defined for the decision rule @xmath22 :    @xmath28    the certainty factor may be interpreted as a conditional probability that decision of rule @xmath22 is consistent with an observation in the decision table @xmath21 , given that premise of the rule is satisfied . 1 summarizes the main operations that are necessary to identify a cellular automaton by using the rough sets approach . in this study , reducts and decision rules are calculated using algorithms implemented in the rses software @xcite . three algorithms of reducts calculation were examined : exhaustive , genetic , and dynamic reduct algorithm . moreover , the experiments involved application of three algorithms that enable induction of decision rules : exhaustive , genetic , and lem2 . in this section , the proposed approach is applied for identification of three deterministic ca @xcite : elementary cellular automaton with wolfram s rule 184 ( eca-184 ) , deterministic version of nagel - schreckenberg cellular automaton ( nash - d ) , and the conway s game of life cellular automaton ( life ) . eca-184 is a one - dimensional cellular automaton with binary cell states and neighborhood of three cells wide . original definition of the eca-184 update rule is presented in fig . 2 . the upper row in this figure illustrates all possible states of a central cell and its neighborhood . lower row shows states of the central cell after update  in the next time step of the ca evolution . identification of eca-184 was performed using a training data set of 500 observations . each observation in the decision table @xmath29 has covered a group of 21 cells ( candidate neighbors ) and the 11-th cell was considered as the central one . the neighborhood of eca-184 was correctly recognized by each of the reducts calculation algorithms ( exhaustive , genetic , and dynamic ) . the shortest reduct was determined as @xmath30 , thus the modified decision table @xmath21 had four attributes : @xmath31 . tab . 1 presents the decision rules that were calculated from table @xmath21 by using the lem2 algorithm . symbol @xmath32 indicates that a given cell state does not occur in a particular decision rule , e.g. , the rule no . 3 from tab . 1 should be interpreted as : @xmath33 . the set of decision rules in tab . 1 is consistent with the original update rule of eca-184 ( fig . the remaining algorithms of rule induction ( exhaustive and genetic ) have also generated valid sets of decision rules ; however their size was larger ( 6 rules ) . .decision rules generated for eca-184 [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the unrealistic model behavior may occur because the decisions for uncertain rules are made randomly , without any coordination . e.g. , the rules 7 and 13 in tab . 5 apply to the same configuration of cells @xmath34 . if for both rules the random decision is 1 then the resulting configuration @xmath35 includes three instead of two occupied cells . this problem was resolved by adding error detection rules to the ca update algorithm . if error is detected by rules ( 4 ) then the update of cells @xmath36 is repeated . @xmath37    above modifications allow the ca to perform realistic simulation of traffic flow . 3 presents time space diagrams for two shock waves . the shock wave a ) was observed in real highway traffic and the shock wave b ) was obtained from evolution of the identified ca . this example illustrates the possibility of using the rough sets approach for identification of ca - based models of real - world phenomena . results of the introductory research show that the data exploration techniques based on rough sets theory enable proper selection of neighborhood and update rule induction for different classes of ca . it was also demonstrated that the rough sets approach is suitable for ca models identification from real - world data sets . the best results were obtained for the proposed ca identification procedure when implemented by using the dynamic reducts algorithm for neighborhood selection and the lem2 algorithm for decision rules induction . nevertheless , in case of stochastic ca identification , some additional actions were necessary ( reduct shortening , adding error detection rules ) . verification of the usability of the proposed approach for a wider set of data as well as comparison with state - of - art methods based on genetic algorithms remain open issues for further research . another interesting topic for future studies is to apply the proposed method in a data exploration system for ca - based image processing @xcite . ladniak m. , piorkowski a. , mlynarczuk m. : the data exploration system for image processing based on server - side operations . in : saeed , k. et al . cisim 2013 . lncs 8104 , pp 168 -

[ fig : profile ] ) . the pulse profile does not show any obvious energy dependence . the 1.810  kev lightcurve does not show evidence for variability . the obtained when fitting a constant value to the lightcurve with 4096  s bins is 11.9 for 12 dof . the 3@xmath20 upper limit to any variability on this timescale is @xmath2122%  rms . lecs and mecs data were extracted centered on the position of   using a radius of 4  for both instruments . both spectra were rebinned to a minimum of 30 counts per bin , and oversampling the full - width at half maximum of the energy resolution by at most a factor 3 to allow use of the @xmath22 statistic . response matrices appropriate to the off - axis source location in the fov were used and spectral fits performed in the 1.06  kev ( lecs ) and 1.810  kev ( mecs ) energy ranges . uncertainties are given at 68% confidence for one interesting parameter . due to the presence of counts from the galactic ridge within the source extraction region , background spectra were extracted from 3 different source free regions at the same offset in the fov as the source and with the same extraction radius . each mecs background spectrum contains @xmath11250  counts . fits using these backgrounds give consistent results , so a mean background was used in the subsequent analysis . uncertainty in the zero - level due to uncertainties in the background level is indicated by the dashed lines , width=321 ]    the spectrum can be well fit with a power - law model giving a @xmath22 of 6.8 for 9 dof , with a photon index , @xmath23 , of @xmath4 , when the low - energy absorption , , was fixed at the galactic value in the direction of the source of @xmath24  ( dickey & lockman @xcite ) this fit is shown in fig . [ fig : spec ] . trials with  as a free parameter show that this parameter can only be constrained to be @xmath21@xmath25  . the unabsorbed 210  kev flux is @xmath26  erg  cm  @xmath27  s@xmath9 ( the 210 kev flux absorbed by the galactic value is only 12% lower ) . when a narrow line with an energy of 6.45@xmath28  kev and an equivalent width with a 1-@xmath20 lower limit of 1.3 kev is added to the model , the reduces to 3.5 for 7 dof and @xmath23 is @xmath29 . although the line feature appears quite evident in fig . [ fig : spec ] , an f - test reveals that the addition of this feature is only significant at a confidence level of 90% . a similar line feature is also evident in the mean mecs background spectrum , but with an intensity @xmath110.25 of that above . thus , unless the background line intensity varies by a factor @xmath115 on a spatial scale of 15 , the probable line feature is associated with the pulsar . since the source is partly obscured by the mecs entrance window support structure , a mecs spectrum was extracted with a 2  radius in order to investigate this effect . the appropriate off - axis response matrix was used . the fit parameters so derived are consistent with those obtained from the spectra extracted with a 4  radius . the only significant difference is in the unabsorbed 210  kev flux estimate which increases to @xmath8  erg  @xmath6  s@xmath9 . this is thus the best estimate of the source intensity . although  is in the fov of the non - imaging high pressure gas scintillation proportional counter ( 5120  kev ) and phoswich detector system ( 15300  kev ) instruments , no useful spectral or timing information could be extracted from these data . we have searched the x - ray catalogs at the heasarc for any previous observations of the region of sky containing . no previous detections of a source with a position consistent with  are reported . the two most sensitive observations of the  region were by rxte and rosat . this region of sky was observed twice by rxte during scans of the galactic plane ( valinia & marshall @xcite ) . from their fig .  1 the upper limit to the strength of any possible point source near  is @xmath1120  pca count  s@xmath9 . this corresponds to a 210 kev flux ( using the bepposax power - law spectral parameters ) of @xmath30  erg  cm  @xmath27  s@xmath9 , which is a factor @xmath1140 greater than the intensity observed by bepposax .    during the rosat all - sky survey the region of sky containing was observed . no source at a position consistent with the new pulsar is present in the bright source catalogue with an upper limit of 0.05  count  s@xmath9 ( voges et al . @xcite ) , corresponding to an unabsorbed flux of @xmath11@xmath31  erg  cm  @xmath27  s@xmath9 , again significantly above the intensity observed here . however , the rosat count rate to flux conversion depends strongly on the amount of interstellar absorption , which is not well constrained by our observation . the line of sight towards  intersects the spiral arms of our galaxy at @xmath111.5 , 4 , and 12  kpc . we have searched the usno - a on - line database for possible optical counterparts . [ fig : ccd ] shows the color - magnitude diagram for stars located in and around the  error region . assuming that the optical counterpart is of spectral type o or b ( either a main - sequence or a ( super-)giant star , see sect . [ sect : discussion ] ) , the absence of a bright blue star in the bepposax error region indicates that the distance is @xmath76kpc , and probably less than about 12 kpc ( since this is the `` edge '' of the galaxy ) . this implies a 210  kev luminosity of ( 415)@xmath10  erg  s@xmath9 . recently , the population of accretion - powered x - ray pulsars has increased markedly , due to observations with the sensitive detectors on rosat , asca , rxte and bepposax . bildsten et al .

cycle of the software is iterative - incremental , every iteration representing an evolution , an improvement , an extension in comparison with the previous one . iterations in the statistical toolkit development process are driven by the needs of its experimental applications ; practical use cases steer the implementations of new tests . the first development cycles of the statistical toolkit implemented a set of goodness - of - fit ( gof ) tests for the two - sample problem , i.e. for the comparison of two distributions . these developments were motivated by experimental requirements for regression testing , validation of simulation with respect to experimental data , comparison of expected versus reconstructed distributions , and more in general for the comparison of data from different sources . new requirements have been identified , based on the experience of using the statistical toolkit in several analyses for the validation of geant4 physics models . these projects highlighted the need for complementary functionality , beyond the problem of assessing the compatibility of two distributions . one of the problems faced in simulation validation ( and , more in general , in the comparison of experimental distributions ) , consists in the identification of possible systematic effects : tests of randomness address this requirement . another problem encountered in the experience with the simulation validation consists of the comparison not only of individual data distributions , but also of categories ( e.g. the evaluation of differences in the behaviour of two geant4 physics models with respect to a set of experimental test cases ) . goodness - of - fit tests quantify the compatibility of the agreement between a set of sample observations and the the corresponding values predicted from some model of interest , or between two ( or more ) sets of observations . the result of a goodness - of - fit test is expressed through a @xmath0-value , which represents the probability that the test statistic has a value at least as extreme as that observed , assuming the null hypothesis is true . the collection of tests implemented in the current version of the statistical toolkit is given in table [ old_tests ] ; extensive details can be found in @xcite . lll gof test & distribution type & ` < comparisonalgorithm > ` class + & & ` andersondarlingbinned ` + & & ` andersondarlingbinnedapproximated ` + & & ` andersondarlingunbinned ` + & & ` andersondarlingunbinnedapproximated ` + & & ` chi2 ` + & & ` chi2approximated ` + & & ` chi2integrating ` + & ` binned ` & ` cramervonmisesbinned ` + & ` unbinned ` & ` cramervonmisesunbinned ` + & ` unbinned ` & ` weightedcramervonmisesbuningunbinned ` + girone & ` unbinned ` & ` girone ` + goodman & ` unbinned ` & ` kolmogorovsmirnovapproximated ` + & & ` kolmogorovsmirnov ` + & & ` weightedadkolmogorovsmirnov ` + & & ` weightedbuningkolmogorovsmirnov ` + kuiper & ` unbinned ` & ` kuiper ` + & ` binned ` & ` tikubinned ` + & ` unbinned ` & ` tikuunbinned ` + watson & ` unbinned ` & ` watson ` + an effort has been invested to provide an effective software development environment , which exploits more modern tools and facilitates the use of the statistical toolkit in a variety of computing environments .    for the new development cycle subversion ( svn ) @xcite has been selected as a tool in support of the configuration and change management discipline . the statistical toolkit code was moved to a svn repository .    in order to facilitate using the statistical toolkit on a wide variety of operating systems , the build system has been moved to the cross platform make ( cmake ) @xcite system . the ` ctest ` testing tool , distributed as a part of cmake , is used for unit testing .    to be as self - consistent as possible , the number of dependencies on external software systems has been minimized . the only essential external dependency is on the gnu scientific library @xcite . an additional user layer was implemented to facilitate the use of the statistical toolkit in analysis environment that are concerned neither with aida @xcite nor with root @xcite analysis objects , which are supported by the two user layers available in the current version . the new user layer allows the analyst to supply input data to the statistical toolkit in the form of comma - separated lists of values ( csv ascii files ) . if no external dependencies are specified , this user layer is built by default . otherwise , in properly set - up environments aida or root ( or both ) are found by ` cmake`and the corresponding user layer is built automatically . the statistical toolkit comes with an extensive set of ` unittests ` , which are meant to test the correct implementation of the statistical tests for each new version of the statistical toolkit . the new development cycle extends the functionality of the statistical toolkit with tests for randomness , one sample goodness - of - fit tests , i.e. comparing data to reference functions , and tests for categorical data . table [ new_tests ] lists the new tests . lll test & input data & class name + wald - wolfowitz & sequence of & ` waldwolfowitztwosamplesrunstest ` + runs test & signs ( -1/1 ) & ` waldwolfowitzonesamplerunstest ` + wald -

random relationship between the order of the experiments and the outcome . the wald - wolfowitz test from @xcite is the best known test that is based on the number of runs . it has been proposed as a test of whether two samples are from the same population , but as such has poor power @xcite and the mann - whitney test is preferable . the new version of the statistical toolkit ( to be released ) encompasses implementations of the the wald - wolfowitz runs test for one or two samples . when the test is used with two samples , the algorithm in @xcite is used to construct one ( binary ) sample , and results from the test for one sample are returned .    to calculate the @xmath0-values , either the exact or an approximated formula can be used . the exact calculation of the two - tailed probability of the test statistics implemented in the statistical toolkit follows the description from @xcite , while the approximated formula takes into account that for large samples the distribution of the number of runs approaches a normal distribution . wilcoxon @xcite published a test for comparison of two samples , based on comparison of the general size of the two samples , ranking of the ( combined ) samples and then comparing the average ranks of separate ranks . the developments of the test followed fast and the first to publish it were mann and whitney @xcite . the new version of the statistical toolkit implements the mann - whitney @xmath1 test and an approximated formula for the @xmath0-value calculation , again assuming that the samples are large , hence the distribution of the ranks can be described with a normal distribution . categorical data analysis involves testing the significance of the association ( contingency ) between the groups . in practice the number of categories is usually small ( below 20 ) , although in principle the tests for categorical data could be used for any number of groups . the difference between the observed and the expected data , considering the given marginal and the assumptions of the model of independence , can be calculated using the @xmath3 test ( already available in the statistical toolkit ) ; however , the @xmath3 test gives only an estimate of the true probability value . the estimate might be inaccurate in case the marginal is very uneven or if there is a small value ( less than five ) in one of the cells of the contingency table . fisher s exact test for contingency tables @xcite is most widely known exact test for categorical data analysis . it is calculated by generating all tables that are more extreme than the table given by the user . to get the two - tailed @xmath0-value , the @xmath0-values of the tables that have @xmath0-values of the same size or smaller than the data table probability are added up to form the cumulative @xmath0-value , including the @xmath0-value of the data table itself . this method becomes computationally intensive already for moderately sized tables , since the number of table probabilities to be enumerated can easily reach billions . fisher s exact test for @xmath2 contingency tables is available in the new development version of the statistical toolkit . an algorithm to calculate the @xmath3 test with yates continuity correction has also been implemented as part of the new development cycle . the @xmath3 tests can be applied to general ( @xmath4 ) contingency tables , while due to computational reasons fisher s exact test is only implemented for @xmath9 tables . the new development cycle of the statistical toolkit comes with a more versatile build system and provides the user significant extensions in testing capabilities . the new tests extend the statistical toolkit capabilities with tests for randomness and tests for categorical data analysis . the new user layer component makes it possible to use the toolkit with many spreadsheet applications that allow exporting data directly to comma separated list of values . new tests , together with the new user layer , make the statistical toolkit a powerful data analysis tool for experimental physics problems concerned with data comparisons . this paper is dedicated to the memory of the late paolo viarengo , who contributed to the previous development cycles of the statistical toolkit . 10 url # 1#1urlprefix[2][]#2 cirrone g  a  p , donadio s , guatelli s , mantero a , mascialino b , parlati s , pia m  g , pfeiffer a , ribon a and viarengo p 2004 _ ieee trans . sci . _ * 51 * 2056              barrand g , binko p , dnszelmann m , johnson a and pfeiffer a 2001 abstract interfaces for data analysis : component architecture for data analysis tools . oai : cds.cern.ch:519004 tech . rep . cern -

suen thinning algorithm @xcite is applied here to show how input errors and uncertainties influence the skeleton .    as shown in figure 2 , inaccurate input can cause not only bad shape recognition but also what is worse ; it can change connectivity of objects . input picture consists of one object that has shape `` o '' . the desired skeleton consists of one line object that preserves this shape and also preserves connectivity ( it is not connected with other object ) . on the other hand , skeleton which was acquired without any pre - processing , like any morphological operation like dilation and erosion consists of more objects that hardly describe original shape and it does not preserve connectivity of its origin at all .    figure 3 demonstrate the possibilities of using morphological operators dilation(d ) and erosion(e ) using hypergraph in pre - processing phase to eliminate most common errors like noise , line fuzz , holes and separations . picture a is binary input from which it is possible to get pictures j , g , b and e by using different number and order of dilation and erosion operations using hypergraph . while only one hypergraph dilation and erosion was used in pictures g and b. pictures j and e show possibilities of using higher number of the same morphological operations using hypergraph one after another . opening operation using hypergraph is good for noise reduction and line fuzz removal . picture b shows that all noise and small line fuzz was removed . its effect depends on number of iterations ie , number of dilation and erosion as it is shown in picture e , where two iterations were used . if too much iteration is used there is a danger of erasing real parts of the object ( line fuzz ) or whole objects at all ( noise ) . similar situation is shown in pictures g and j , where hypergraph closing is used . this operation causes holes reduction . also there is a threat of using too much iteration as it can fill objects that can lead to loss of their line characteristic morphological operations like dilation , erosion using hypergraph in pre -

( for a derivation of the sum rule , and the precise meaning of all quantities , see ref . an important observation for the analysis to follow is that a monomial of degree @xmath12 in the weight @xmath13 picks out the term of order @xmath14 in the ope , because @xmath15 the @xmath16 term in the ope represents the mass - independent , purely perturbative contribution , which is available to @xmath17 @xcite . in the literature , two different resummation schemes , `` fixed - order '' ( fo or fopt ) and `` contour - improved '' ( ci or cipt ) @xcite have been employed . following ref . @xcite , we have considered both . the analysis of ref .  @xcite starts with the weights @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and takes @xmath20 in the sum rule ( [ sumrule ] ) . since @xmath21 is negligibly small , the parameters in the fit to these 5 weighted integrals would be @xmath22 and @xmath23 , because @xmath24 has degree 7 ( _ cf . _  eq .

[ fig : fig_desitter ] , this diagram shows the typical behavior of cosmological scale - factor in the de sitter universe . those behavior are apparently different in the case of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . the lines ( labeled @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) are curves in the case of cosmological constant @xmath25 with curvature @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . in the inflationary scenario , the vacuum energy of the scalar field ( or inflaton ) @xmath6 plays the same role with the cosmological constant @xmath33 . the solid line ( the lowest line labeled @xmath34 ) is curve in the case of @xmath26 with @xmath32 , which is the only case of solution in de sitter universe with @xmath26 . here the universe necessarily recollapses and thus the spacetime has a finite extent in time in the future . those are limited by the value of cosmological constant @xmath35 . though there are some interesting features in this case , it is usually regarded as no physical meaning . we consider the total action of einstein gravity and a real scalar field @xmath6 coupled non - minimally with the spacetime curvature . @xmath36 ,    \\label{eq : action}\\ ] ] where @xmath0 is the coupling constant between the scalar field @xmath6 and the space - time curvature @xmath8 . @xmath9 and @xmath37 correspond to minimal and conformal couplings , respectively . @xmath38 is the potential for the scalar field .    from the above expression , we find that an effective gravitational constant @xmath39 where @xmath40 thus it gives us a negative effective gravitational constant for a reasonable choice of @xmath41 , i.e. , @xmath42 for @xmath43 . as mentioned in the introduction it has been shown that the anisotropic shear diverges as @xmath6 approaches to @xmath44 in the cases of flat and closed geometry@xcite . when the coupling constant is in the range @xmath45 , there is another singular point @xmath46 this may be seen from the structure of the hamiltonian constrain@xcite . @xmath47 the constraint also indicates that there is no isotropic classical solution for @xmath48 in the closed or flat universe . only possibility to have an isotropic spacetime for @xmath49 is the case where the spatial curvature is negative @xmath50 which we will consider in detail in the following section . we now consider an open isotropic universe in the presence of a nonminimally coupled scalar field . when we restrict our consideration in frw spacetime denoted by eq . ( [ eq : metric ] ) , the einstein equations are found to be @xmath51    = \\frac{8\\pi}{3 } \\left [ \\frac{\\dot{\\phi}^2}{2 } + 6\\xi\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\phi}\\phi + v(\\phi ) \\right ] ,      \\label{eq : einstein}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 and dot denotes the derivative with respect to time . the scalar field equation is found to be @xmath53 where @xmath54 is effective potential and its gradient is written as @xmath55   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the following we assume @xmath56 with @xmath57 as a typical example . we shall then numerically solve the above set of equations ( [ eq : einstein ] ) and ( [ eq : phi - field ] ) for the case @xmath58 . we present the results of calculation with @xmath59(@xmath60 ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 . we notice that there is upper limit for the initial value about 30 in this case otherwise one can not satisfy eq . ( [ eq : einstein ] ) at the initial time . fig.[fig : fig_2 ] shows evolutions of the scalar field ( upper figure ) and the scale factor ( lower figure ) . those are scaled in planck unit . the lines ( labeled @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) are solutions with the initial value of scalar field as @xmath1 = 10 , 5 , 2 , respectively . these @xmath4 open universe look like @xmath4 open anti - de sitter universe with negative cosmological constant @xmath26 in fig.[fig : fig_desitter ] . we also draw the solid curve ( labeled @xmath34 ) in the case of @xmath63 with @xmath1 = 5 under @xmath64=+1 closed universe for comparison . this is a most popular case known as _ chaotic inflationary universe_@xcite . fig.[fig : fig_3 ] is the same as fig . [ fig : fig_2 ] , but the lines ( labeled @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) are solutions with the initial value of scalar field as @xmath1 = 5 , 20 , 25 , respectively . in the case of @xmath1 = 5 , the scalar field @xmath6 seems to be blocked by barrier of the critical value @xmath60 so as not to go through it for a long time , and then the scalar field @xmath6 blows up to infinitely large value . this behavior may be understood by noticing that the gradient of the effective potential diverges as the scalar field approaches to @xmath2 . the evolution of scale factor looks like that of de sitter universe with @xmath32 and @xmath26 , which necessarily come to collapse into zero ( @xmath65 ) in a finite time . in the case of large initial values such as @xmath66 , the scalar field @xmath6 decreases first to near the @xmath2 , keep a value for a while , and blow up go to infinitely large value . then the evolution of scale factor experiences a bounce era and goes to recollapse in the end . we investigated the evolutionary behavior of an open isotropic universe dominate by a nonminimally coupled scalar field in the range @xmath67 . we found by numerical analysis that the scalar field can not cross the singular point @xmath2 and instead diverges to infinity . according to the behavior of the scalar field , the expansion of the universe is turn around and is collapsing to singularity . this behavior is similar to an open de sitter universe with a negative cosmological constant eq . ( [ eq : de - sitter ] ) . this could be understood by writing the expansion equation in the following form . @xmath68 }                             { ( { \\phi^2}/{\\phi_c^2 } -1 ) }                      -   k \\,\\,e^{-2\\alpha}\\ ] ] thus the energy density of the scalar field plays a role of a negative cosmological constant in a sense . if the cosmological constant @xmath69 is not zero , the effective cosmological constant @xmath70 is found to be @xmath71 it is found that non positive effective cosmological constant @xmath70 appears even if @xmath72 in some range of the scalar field @xmath73 . thus it might gives us a possible mechanism to reduce the cosmological constant to a small value . there are also other solutions which shows a rebouncing behavior before the eventual collapse to the singularity . it seems to us that this kind of behavior has not been known before . just after the bounce the expansion is accelerated . then it might be possible to have a new open inflationary scenario by adjusting parameters ( initial value of the scalar field and the coupling constant ) . it also interesting to consider how anisotropic shear behaves in the singular point in our open universe . our preliminary result show that the anisotropy diverges also as one approaches to @xmath44 also in the open universe . this will be published elsewhere . 99 e. w. kolb and m. s. turner , _ the early universe _ ( addison - wesley , new york , 1990 ) . a. d. linde , _ particle physics and inflationary cosmology _ ( harwood academic , switzerland , 1990 ) . a. d. linde , phys . 129b * , 177 ( 1983 ) v. r. eke et al . astro - ph/9802350 , ( 1998 ) t. futamase and k. maeda , phys . d * 39 * , 399 ( 1989 ) t. futamase , t. rothman and r. matzner , phys . d * 39 * , 405 ( 1989 ) a. a. starobinsky , pisma astron . * 7 * , 67 ( 1981 ) [ sov . astron . lett . * 7 * , 67 ( 1981 ) ] r. fakir and w. g. unruh , phys . d * 41 * , 1783 ( 1990 ) r. fakir , phys . d * 41 * , 3012 ( 1990 ) r. fakir and s. habib , mod . a * 30 * , 2827 ( 1993 ) j. r. gott , nature(london ) * 295 * , 304 ( 1982 ) m. bucher , a. s. goldhaber and n. turok , phys . d * 52 * , 3314 ( 1995 ) w. l. freedman et al . nature(london ) * 371 * , 757 ( 1994 ) k. maeda , j. a. stein - schabes and t. futamase , phys .  rev . d * 39 * , 2848 ( 1989 ) g. steigman and m. turner , phys . 128b * , 295 ( 1983 ) t. rothman and g. f. r. ellis , phys . b * 180 * , 19 ( 1986 ) m. sasaki , t. tanaka , k. yamamoto and j. yokoyama , phys . b * 317 * , 510 ( 1993 ) l. g. jensen and j. a. stein - schabes , phys . d * 35 * , 1146 ( 1987 ) p. m. garnavich et al . astrophys . j. * 493 * , l53 , ( 1998 ) "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " we investigated the behavior of an open isotropic universe generated by a scalar field which couples with background curvature nonminimally with the coupling constant @xmath0 .   in particular we focus on the situation where the initial value for the scalar field @xmath1 is greater than the critical value @xmath2=@xmath3 .   the behavior is similar to an open de sitter universe with @xmath4 with a negative cosmological constant @xmath5 .   it is found that the universe will collapse eventually to a singularity and thus has a finite extent in time in the future . furthermore , there are some cases which shows a rebouncing behavior before the final collapse .      pacs numbers : 98.80.cq , 98.80.hw +  "}]}
