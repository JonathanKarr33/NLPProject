@xcite ; @xcite ) . the growth of structures , particularly during the linear phase preceding the collapse into stars and galaxies , also suggests redshifted hydrogen signals may be produced from structures with redshifts as large as @xmath2 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    the expected wavelength range ( @xmath3 for @xmath4 , or @xmath5 ) is a heavily used region of the spectrum ( e.g. , containing the fm radio band ) , with little regulatory protection for radio astronomy . ground - based arrays designed to detect the redshifted h@xmath6i signal are being deployed , often in the most radio - quiet regions of this planet . however , the absence of local transmitters may not be sufficient as ionized meteor trails and ionospheric layers can reflect power from distant transmitters . in contrast , the far side of the moon is an internationally recognized `` shielded zone '' ( @xcite ) , with emphasis given to protecting it for observations that are `` difficult or impossible from the surface of the earth , '' particularly at wavelengths longer than 1  meter ( @xmath7  mhz ) . the far side is also protected , during a portion of the lunar orbit , from solar radio emissions . terrestrial and solar interference may ultimately be a limiting factor for ground - based telescopes and a lunar - based telescope will be necessary to exploit fully the hydrogen signal from the . the magnetic polar regions of the earth and the solar system giant planets host intense electron cyclotron masers generated by solar - wind powered electron currents . magnetospheric emission can aid the understanding of extrasolar planets by providing information that will be difficult to obtain otherwise : the existence of a magnetic field constrains the interior of a planet while modulation of the emission can yield its rotation rate . for a terrestrial planet , a magnetic field may be important for habitability , shielding the planet from the harmful effects of energetic charged particles ( e.g. , @xcite ) . empirical relations for solar system planets suggest that radio emission from extrasolar planets may be detectable over interstellar distances ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . magnetospheric emissions from the solar system planets show a rough correspondence between planetary mass and emission wavelength , and _ only jovian radio emissions are at a short enough wavelength that they can be detected from the ground_. observations above the earth s ionosphere will be needed to detect and study sub - jovian mass extrasolar planets . acceleration of particles to super - thermal and relativistic velocities occurs in a variety of astrophysical environments , from the sun and other dwarf stars to neutron stars and black holes to quasars . a fundamental astrophysical problem is understanding the mechanisms and sites of particle acceleration . a key aspect of particle acceleration mechanisms is the low energy population which provides the `` seeds '' from which the highest energy particles result . these low energy particles emit , and are best studied at , the longest wavelengths .    within the inner heliosphere ( 210  solar radii , @xmath8 measured from the sun s center ) intense electron beams are produced , at times with particles having energies rivaling `` the energies of some accelerated particles in the distant [ quasars ] '' ( @xcite ) , and a significant fraction of solar wind heating occurs . radio wave observations and spacecraft coronagraphs , notably those on the solar heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , have provided dramatic indications of the violent , magnetically - driven activity of the sun and its connection to particle acceleration . because of its proximity and brightness , the inner heliosphere is one of the best places to study the fundamental physics of particle acceleration .    solar radio bursts are one of the primary manifestations of particle acceleration in the inner heliosphere . previous space - based radio observations have been from single dipole instruments with _ no imaging capabilities_. thus , fundamental questions remain about particle acceleration sites . for example , at  1  , electron acceleration generally occurs where the shock normal is perpendicular to the magnetic field ( quasi - perpendicular , @xcite ) , similar to acceleration at planetary bow shocks and other astrophysical sites . in the corona , the magnetic field is largely radial , yet the existing radio observations suggest that the acceleration site is in front of a , a _ quasi - parallel _ geometry . an imaging instrument , one with even modest angular resolution , is required to locate the sites of radio emission , and therefore the electron acceleration . interest in placing a radio telescope on or around the moon pre - dates the apollo missions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a series of workshops and conferences describe scientific goals and preliminary concepts ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . we begin by discussing technical aspects of the surface of the moon as an observatory site ; the scientific aspects are discussed above . we then turn to how radio observatories might be deployed , with the capability of lunar radio observatories growing with the human presence . some of the value of the moon as an astronomical site ( at long wavelengths ) is also true for a space - based array , and there have been proposals for such arrays ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in contrast to free - flying telescopes at shorter wavelengths ( @xcite ) , the lunar surface offers two significant benefits to a radio array . ( 1 )  a dipole in space responds to the full @xmath9  sr , so a free - flying array must image the full sky all of the time , with all of the sources present ( sun , jupiter ,  ) . limited mass budgets have restricted proposed arrays to a small number of elements . the resultant challenge is to image the entire sky with an extremely sparse aperture . in contrast , on the moon , the lunar surface shields @xmath10  sr , making the imaging problem less challenging , and imaging algorithms developed for terrestrial interferometers can be utilized , whereas a space array requires the development of new algorithms . also , it is practical to deploy a much larger number of dipoles . ( 2 )  in order to form an interferometer , antenna separations must be known and maintained to a fraction of a wavelength during the observations . while the relevant wavelengths are large ( @xmath11  m ) , station keeping does necessitate use of on - board resources . in contrast , the lunar surface is stable with an extremely low level of seismic activity , so antenna positions can be determined once and then assumed constant .      the rolss array is a concept designed for deployment during the first lunar sorties ( figure  [ fig : lazio.rolss ] ) . it is intended to conduct astronomical observations of the sun , primarily for the purpose of probing particle acceleration mechanisms , as well as to serve as a pathfinder for future , larger arrays . the baseline rolss array consists of  3 arms arranged in a ` y ` configuration with an operational wavelength range of  30300  m ( 110  mhz ) , i.e. , at wavelengths longer than can be accessed from the ground . each arm hosts 16 antennas and is 500  m long , providing approximately @xmath12 angular resolution at  30-m wavelength ( 10  mhz ) . the arms themselves consist of a polyimide film ( pf ) on which electrically - short dipole antennas are deposited , and they hold the transmission system for sending the electrical signals back to the central processing facility , located at the intersection of the arms . the central processing facility would select a 100  khz sub - band within the operational wavelength range , filter and digitize the signals , then downlink them to the ground for final imaging and scientific analysis . observations at long wavelengths can address a number of important science priorities , as discussed above , however , the arrays required to conduct the requisite observations are much larger than the rolss array . a value of interferometers is that they can `` grow , '' with scientific capability increasing as the number of antennas is increased . indeed , many of the ground - based radio interferometers have been preceded by prototypes having a much smaller number of antennas , but which were scientifically productive themselves , and scientific observations began with many of the ground - based radio interferometers well before they reached their final complement of antennas . stage  i ( rolss ) : :    a small interferometer located on the near side . stage  ii : :    a modest - sized interferometer ( e.g. , 256 dipoles spread over a few to    several kilometers ) , possibly though not necessarily located on the    far side of the moon . such an interferometer might be capable of    detecting the brightest extrasolar planets , and verifying ground - based    observations of the . stage  iii : :    a fully capable interferometer located on the far side . part of this work was carried out at the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . basic research in radio astronomy at nrl is supported by 6.1 base funding . jones , d. , allen , r. , basart , j. , 2000 the astronomical low - frequency array : a proposed explorder mission for radio astronomy . in _ radio astronomy at long wavelengths _ r.  g.  stone , k.  w.  weiler , m.  l.  goldstein & j .- l .  bougeret ) vol . 119 , p.  339349 . geophys .  union . loeb , a. , & zaldarriaga , m. 2004 , measuring the small - scale power spectrum of cosmic density fluctuations through 21  cm tomography prior to the epoch of structure formation . _ physical rev . _ , * 92 * , i d .  211301 . macdowall , r.  j. , gopalswamy , n. , kaiser , m.  l. , 2006 microsat and lunar - based imaging of radio bursts . in _ planetary radio emissions  . _ ( ed .  h.  o.  rucker , w.  s.  kurth , & g.  mann ) p.  491504 . austrian academy press .

@xcite ) , the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) , and the 2mass survey @xcite have provided very large local galaxy samples with spectroscopic and/or photometric information in various passbands . thanks to these data sets we are now able to assess very accurate local ( @xmath6 ) reference points for many galaxy evolution measurements like the luminosity function , the star formation activity , the spatial clustering of galaxies , the stellar population , the morphology , etc .    in the redshift range between @xmath7 pioneering work has been done in the context of the canada france redshift survey @xcite , the autofib survey @xcite and in the canadian network for observational cosmology survey @xcite . they provide accurate distances and absolute luminosities by spectroscopic followup of optically selected galaxies , thus being able to probe basic properties of galaxy evolution . moreover the k20-survey @xcite as well as the munics survey @xcite extend the analysis into the near infrared regime ( for @xmath8 ) . an important step towards probing the galaxy properties also in the high redshift regime around @xmath9 and @xmath10 was the work of @xcite and @xcite . they used colour selection to discriminate between low and high redshift galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . the so - called lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs , mainly starburst galaxies at high redshift ) are selected by means of important features in the uv spectrum of star - forming galaxies . the next milestones in pushing the limiting magnitude for detectable galaxies to fainter and fainter limits were the space based hubble deep field north ( hdfn ; @xcite ) and hubble deep field south ( hdfs ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) . although of a limited field of view of about @xmath11 only , the depth of the hdfs allowed the detection of galaxies up to a redshift of 5 and even beyond .    in the past years the space based hdfs were supplemented by many more multi - band photometric surveys like the ntt susi deep field ( ndf ; @xcite ) , the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ; @xcite ) , the william herschel deep field ( whdf ; @xcite ) , the subaru deep field / survey ( sdf ; @xcite ) , the combo-17 survey @xcite , fires @xcite , the fors deep field ( fdf ; @xcite ) , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ; @xcite ) , the ultra deep field ( udf and udf - parallel acs fields ; @xcite ) , the virmos deep survey @xcite , gems @xcite , the keck deep fields @xcite , and the multiwavelength survey by yale - chile ( musyc ; @xcite ) .    with the advent of all these deep multi - band photometric surveys the photometric redshift technique ( essentially a generalisation of the drop - out technique ) can be used to identify high - redshift galaxies . photometric redshifts are often determined by means of template matching algorithm that applies bayesian statistics and uses semi - empirical template spectra matched to broad - band photometry ( see also @xcite ) . redshifts of galaxies that are several magnitudes fainter than typical spectroscopic limits can be determined reliably with an accuracy of of 0.02 to 0.1 .    in this context the cosmos survey ( @xcite ; see also http://www.astro.caltech.edu/cosmos/ for an overview ) combines deep to very - deep multi - waveband information in order to extend the analysis of deep pencil beam surveys to a much bigger volume , thus being able to drastically increase the statistics and detect also very rare objects . for this , the survey covers an area of about @xmath12 with imaging by space - based telescopes ( hubble , spitzer , galex , xmm , chandra ) as well as large ground based telescopes ( subaru , vla , eso - vlt , ukirt , noao , cfht , and others ) .    in this paper we combine publicly available u , b , v , r , i , z , and k cosmos data with proprietary imaging in the h band to derive a homogeneous multi - waveband catalogue suitable for deriving accurate photometric redshifts . in section  [ sec : imaging_data ] we give an overview of the near - infrared ( nir ) data acquisition and we describe our 2-pass data reduction pipeline used to derive optimally ( in terms of signal - to - noise for faint sources ) stacked images in section  [ sec : imaging_reduction ] . we also present nir galaxy number counts and compare them with the literature . + in section  [ sec : isel_catalogue ] we present the deep multi - waveband i - band selected catalogue and discuss its properties , whereas the data reduction of the spectroscopic redshifts is described in section  [ sec : spec ] . in section  [ sec : photoz ] we present the photometric redshift catalogue , discuss the accuracy of the latter and show the redshift distribution of the galaxies . in section  [ sec : uvlf ] we derive the redshift evolution of the restframe uv luminosity function and luminosity density at 1500     from our i - selected catalogue before we summarise our findings in section  [ sec : summary_conclusion ] . we use ab magnitudes and adopt a @xmath13 cosmology throughout the paper with , , and . our observing strategy was designed to follow - up the publicly available cosmos observations with proprietary imaging in h band . the whole area is covered by 25 pointings ( 15.4x15.4 each ) to a depth adequate to the public nir data . the field layout and nomenclature is shown in fig.[fieldnomenclature ] . the programme was carried out as a joint effort between three large extragalactic survey projects currently being pursued at the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) , on calar alto : alhambra @xcite , manos - wide @xcite and munics - deep ( goranova et al . , in prep . ) . in addition , as a part of the munics - deep project , in one of the pointings ( 01c ) we have already collected deep js- and k-band data .      the observations in h , js and k bands were carried out using the nir wide - field imager omega2000 , operating at the prime focus of the caha 3.5 m telescope . omega2000 is equipped with a hawaii-2 hgcdte 2048x2048 array . the instrument pixel scale is 0.45per pixel , providing a field - of - view of 15.4x 15.4 .    here we present the h - band observations in 15 pointings ( see fig.[fieldnomenclature ] ) , collected during 11 nights spanned over 3 observing campaigns : december 2004 , february 2005 , and march / april 2005 . each pointing was observed for a total of at least 3 ksec . the individual exposure times were 3 sec , on - chip co - added to produce single frames of 60 sec each . except for 05b , at least 50 such frames ( depending on the weather conditions ) were observed per pointing . in addition , observations in js and k bands in 01c were collected during 7 night in the observing campaigns november 2003 and february 2006 . the total exposure time in js - band data was 8.2 ksec with the same individual exposure time scheme as for the h band . the k-band observations have a total of 7.7 ksec exposure time with individual exposures of 2 sec , co - added internally into single frames of 30 sec each . all observations were done using dithering pattern consisting of typically 20 positions shifted with respect to one another by 20 . the consecutive dithering sequences were repeated with the same pattern but with an offset in the origin . the observing log presenting filters , pointings nomenclature , coordinates , number of frames , and the total exposure time per pointing are listed in table  [ tab : obslog ] . .[tab : obslog ] the 15 cosmos patches . the table gives the filter , the field name , the coordinates ( right ascension @xmath14 and declination @xmath15 ) for the equinox 2000 , the number of frames , and the total exposure time .

[ tem ] we show transmission electron micrographs of mos@xmath0-particles which were synthesized by solid - gas reaction . control of size and shape is rather difficult , as evidenced by the irregularly faceted shapes . however , the methods used for the synthesis of hollow nanoparticles are developing very rapidly , and it is to be expected that control of size , thickness and shape will become much better in the future .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     hollow nanoparticles combine covalent in - plane strength with flexible out - of - plane bending of thin films , which results in high mechanical stability . they interact by van der waals ( vdw ) forces , which for example determine the material properties of fullerite @xcite and the phase behavior of buckyballs @xcite . vdw interactions become even more important for larger fullerenes , carbon onions and inorganic fullerenes ; these materials , therefore , feature a large degree of non - specific adhesion . in particular , vdw adhesion can lead to deformation of the hollow nanoparticles . for example , it has been found that carbon nanotubes adhering to each other or to flat surfaces show observable deformations for radii as small as 1 nm @xcite . in the presence of local surface features like crystal steps , adhering nanoparticles will have spacially varying electronic properties due to spacially varying deformation . hollow nanoparticles may lead to new applications in nanoelectronics and -optics . in contrast to filled nanoparticles , they can also be used for storage and delivery systems . they show superior mechanical properties , like high flexibility , high tensile strength and light weight , which will lead to applications as ultra - strong fibers . larger fibers can be produced using the cohesiveness provided by vdw interactions . inorganic fullerenes have also been shown to offer favorable tribological properties @xcite . detailed investigations with the surface force apparatus demonstrated that low friction and wear is caused by material transfer onto the sliding surfaces @xcite .    for these applications , a good theoretical understanding of the physical properties of hollow nanoparticles is important . here we discuss structural properties of spherical hollow nanoparticles in a continuum approach that allows us to focus on unusual generic properties which result mainly from geometrical effects . in particular , we address mechanical properties , van der waals interaction , thermodynamic behavior and deformation by adhesion . in this paper , we focus on the main results of our work ; more details can be found elsewhere @xcite . during recent years , mechanical properties of fullerenes and carbon nanotubes have been extensively studied at the level of molecular calculations , that is by first principles , tight binding and force field techniques . the advantage of molecular models is that they can provide detailed quantitative predictions . for larger systems like multi - walled nanoparticles , their implementation becomes difficult due to computer time requirements . here we use classical continuum elasticity theory , which is asymptotically correct for large systems and allows us to treat all these systems using the same framework . the large advantage of this approach is that it provides insight into the generic properties of these systems . molecular calculations for carbon nanotubes have shown that the predictions of continuum elasticity theory persist well into the limit of radii smaller than 1 nm @xcite . recently this observation could be verified also for bn and mos@xmath0 nanotubes @xcite . the layered material discussed here usually has a hexagonal lattice structure , for which elasticity theory @xcite predicts that there are only two in - plane elastic constants and the sheet is elastically isotropic . its deformation energy consists of stretching and bending terms . for single - walled carbon sheets , the in - plane stretching modulus @xmath6 erg/@xmath7 and the out - of - plane bending rigidity @xmath8 erg . for both mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , @xmath9 is smaller by a factor @xmath10 and @xmath11 is larger by a factor @xmath12 . for multi - walled nanoparticles , the elastic constants scale with thickness @xmath2 as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the largest in - plane elastic constant of the corresponding layered material @xcite . the values for @xmath15 are @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 erg/@xmath19 for c , mos@xmath0 and ws@xmath0 , respectively . stretching can be avoided completely by bending the sheet into a cylindrical nanotube . however , this is not possible for spherical nanoparticles , which we discuss here . the same holds true for saddle - like structures , and in general for all surfaces with non - zero gaussian curvature . on a microscopic level , the requirement for non - zero gaussian curvature also means that a flat sheet can not be bent into a sphere without introducing defects . continuum elasticity approaches to fullerenes therefore explicitly treated the 12 pentagonal defects necessary to close a sheet of carbon hexagons @xcite . in order to avoid this complication , here we assume that the curvature generating defects are distributed in a homogeneous manner and result in a vanishing internal strain ( like for a ping - pong ball ) . in this case , the hollow nanospheres can be modeled as elastic shells with thickness @xmath2 and prefered radius @xmath1 . mechanical collapse in tribological applications is likely to be caused by either direct forces or high pressure . in the latter case , an inward buckling instability occurs , since the pressure energy scales with a higher power of indentation @xmath20 than the restoring elastic energy ( @xmath21 versus @xmath22 ) @xcite . mechanical collapse is expected when indentation @xmath20 becomes of the order of radius @xmath1 . the critical pressure for collapse can then be estimated to be @xmath23 . for buckyballs and typical inorganic fullerenes , this yields values of 15 and 2 gpa , respectively . for nanoparticles , the corresponding forces are in the nn - range . since vdw interactions are very difficult to treat on a molecular level , a continuum approach is even more useful in this case . it is well known from colloid science that vdw interactions strongly depend on the geometry of the system under investigation . geometrical aspects of vdw interactions are well treated in the hamaker approach , in which an atomic lennard - jones interaction is summed in a pairwise manner over the relevant geometry and the molecular details of the interaction are lumped into the effective lennard - jones parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 . for carbon , @xmath26 and @xmath27 erg @xcite . the corresponding hamaker constant @xmath28 is in the order of @xmath29 erg . for two buckyballs , the hamaker approach for thin sheets leads to the _ girifalco potential _ @xcite , which is considerably shorter ranged than a lennard - jones potential . since a small range of attraction leads to the disappearance of the gas - liquid coexistence from the phase diagram @xcite , it has been suggested that buckyballs constitute the first non - colloidal system for which the gas - liquid critical point does not appear in the phase diagram . however , large scale simulations have shown that buckyballs indeed do show a gas - liquid coexistence , which extends roughly from 1900 to 2000@xmath30c @xcite .    for hollow nanoparticles in general , the effect of a finite thickness @xmath2 becomes important . however , for nanoparticles in a crystal or adhering to a flat substrate or to each other , the distance of closest approach @xmath31 between interacting particles is on an atomic scale . under such conditions , the vdw interaction saturates on the atomic scale @xmath31 with increasing thickness @xmath2 . for example , the surface energy for the interaction with a halfspace scales as @xmath32 and @xmath33 for thin films and halfspaces , respectively , with the crossover occuring for @xmath34 . since @xmath35 in our case , the surface energy is @xmath33 independently of @xmath2 and no significant scaling with thickness is expected .    for a more detailed investigation , one has to consider the general case of two nanospheres of finite thickness interacting in a pairwise manner by a lennard - jones potential @xcite . the interaction energy can be written as @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the interaction energy between two filled balls of radii @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , which can be calculated analytically for a lennard - jones potential . in order to predict phase behavior , three quantities characterizing the resulting potential are especially important : the hard core diameter @xmath40 sets the density scale , the potential depth sets the temperature scale , and the interaction range determines if a gas - liquid coexistence occurs ( compare fig . [ tem ] ) . our full analysis has shown that for hollow nanoparticles of radius @xmath1 and thickness @xmath2 , the potential depth and interaction range scale linearly and inversely with @xmath1 . both quantities depend only weakly on @xmath2 . in fig . [ interactionrange ] we show our numerical results for the interaction range as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . recent work for the double - yukawa potential suggests that the gas - liquid coexistence disappears for an interaction range smaller than @xmath41 @xcite . our analysis predicts that this happens for @xmath42 and @xmath43 for single- and multi - walled nanoparticles , respectively . for larger @xmath1 , the critical point will disappear from the phase diagram . we consider the case where a spherical hollow nanoparticle is indented a distance @xmath20 due to adhesion to a flat substrate . the vdw energy gained on adhesion can be estimated to be @xmath44 where @xmath28 is the hamaker constant and @xmath31 an atomic cutoff @xcite . the energy of deformation can be estimated to be @xmath45 . with increasing @xmath1 , deformation becomes more likely , since both the vdw energy and deformability increase . however , deformability decreases rapidly with increasing thickness @xmath2 , since @xmath46 . solving for the indentation @xmath20 and using the values given above , it is found that for hollow carbon nanoparticles with few walls , @xmath20 can be in the nm - range @xcite . however , for typical inorganic fullerenes deformations are suppressed by the larger shell thickness @xmath2 . finally we briefly discuss a nanotube adhering to a flat substrate . as explained above , nanotubes can be bent without being stretched . on deformation , one has to pay a bending energy per length of @xmath47 . the gain in vdw energy scales as @xmath48 . it follows that for carbon nanotubes with small thickness @xmath2 , the indentation @xmath20 can be in the nm - range for even smaller values of radius @xmath1 than for hollow carbon nanoparticles . it is a pleasure to thank r. tenne for many stimulating discussions . uss was supported by the minerva foundation and sk by the ministry of education , science and culture of japan . this estimate is valid for weak adhesion . in @xcite , we used an estimate for strong adhesion , @xmath49 . then the predicted deformation is larger by a factor of @xmath50 , yet the general conclusions are the same . "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " when sheets of layered material like c , ws@xmath0 or bn are restricted to finite sizes , they generally form single- and multi - walled hollow nanoparticles in order to avoid dangling bonds .   using continuum approaches to model elastic deformation and van der waals interactions of spherical nanoparticles , we predict the variation of mechanical stability , adhesive properties and phase behavior with radius @xmath1 and thickness @xmath2 .   we find that mechanical stability is limited by forces in the nn range and pressures in the gpa range .   adhesion energies scale linearly with @xmath1 , but depend only weakly on @xmath2 .   deformation due to van der waals adhesion occurs for single - walled particles for radii of few nm , but is quickly suppressed for increasing thickness .   as @xmath1 is increased , the gas - liquid coexistence disappears from the phase diagram for particle radii in the range of 1 - 3 nm ( depending on wall thickness ) since the interaction range decreases like @xmath3 .

( 1998b ) .    for the polarimetry survey , we used a broad - band polarimeter on the 2.1 m telescope at mcdonald observatory . more details about the observations can be found in grupe et al . ( 1998c ) , where we presented results for the sample defined above . we have complete polarization data for 65 objects . the sample is complete for the northern hemisphere plus some objects of southern declination that are accessible from mcdonald or from which information can be found in the literature . all in all , two thirds were observed by us , and for 1/3 we took data from the literature ( mainly berriman 1989 , berriman et al . 1990 ) . for those objects that turned out to be highly polarized we also obtained spectropolarimetry at the 2.7 m telescope at mcdonald . we compared the results for our soft x - ray agn sample with those from the optically selected narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nlsy1s ) sample that goodrich ( 1989 ) studied by spectropolarimetry . for the goodrich sample we also collected optical spectroscopic and rosat x - ray data . while his sample is biased towards optical properties , it is unbiased with respect to soft x - ray properties , e.g. cold absorption . figure [ distr ] displays the distribution of the degree of polarization for the 65 objects of our soft x - ray selected sample . most of these show no or only low degrees of polarization , p@xmath01% . one object was found with p @xmath41% ( cbs 126 ) , three objects showed p@xmath42% ( ngc1068 , h0439 - 272 , mkn766 ) , and two sources with p@xmath54% were found ( irasf12397 + 3333 , iras13349 + 2438 ) . while iras13349 + 2438 has been extensively studied before ( e.g. wills et al . 1992 , brandt et al . 1996 , 1997 ) , iras f12397 + 3333 is new .    we were curious to find out if there were any differences between polarized and unpolarized agn . we did not find any differences in their line widths or x - ray spectral indices compared with the rest of the sample . however , the polarized agn turned out to be the ones with high balmer decrements and steep ( reddened ) optical continua . these objects seem to be affected by dust . six objects of the sample have shown polarization above 1% : cbs 126 , ngc 1068 , mkn 766 , h 0439 - 272 , iras f12397 + 3333 , and iras 13349 + 2438 . the degree of polarization of cbs 126 turned out to be wavelength independent . probably this can be explained by polarization through aligned dust grains and not by scattering , which would show a stronger wavelength dependence in the degree of polarization . scattering polarized agn show a wavelength dependence because we look for the dilution of the polarized light by unpolarized light . in the case where the unpolarized light absorbed by dust , the unpolarized spectrum is reddened . therefore , the signature of scattering is an increase of the degree of polarization towards the blue . ngc 1068 is a special case in our sample , included because of its extended soft x - ray emission . mkn 766 is also one of the sources in goodrich s nlsy1 sample . we found h 0439 - 272 to be polarized during our 1998 mcdonald observations , so detailed spectrophotometry is not yet available . we concentrate here on the two ` highly polarized ' agn iras 13349 + 2438 and iras f12397 + 3333 . both objects show a strong wavelength dependence in the degree of polarization ( see grupe et al . this is a sign of scattered light . we observed both objects by spectropolarimetry . while the results of this study have been already published for iras 13349 + 2438 ( wills et al . 1992 ) , we are preparing the results of the iras f12397 + 3333 data for publication now . the results of our spectropolarimetry observation of iras f12397 + 3333 show that the there is s slightly higher degree of polarization in the broad lines and a much lower degree of polarization can be seen in the narrow lines . we discuss the significance of this later . as noted before , the polarized agn are those that are highly affected by dust reddening . the question is , should they not be affected by cold , neutral absorption in soft x - rays as well ? why do we see soft x - rays from these highly reddened objects ? objects such as iras 1509 - 21 from goodrich ( 1989 ) s sample shows both high reddening and attenuation of soft x - rays by neutral absorption . the answer may be that the absorption is by dusty , ionized warm gas ( extra ionized absorbers in there ) . this gas absorbs at intermediate x - ray energies ( @xmath4 0.5 - 3.0 kev ) , but is transparent to soft x - rays . if our objects are affected by warm absorbers we can expect to see their characteristic absorption features around 0.7 - 0.9 kev , caused by highly ionized oxygen ions ( ovii at 0.74 kev and oviii at 0.87 kev ) . brandt et al . ( 1996 , 1997 ) have intensively studied the rosat and asca data of iras 13349 + 2438 and found exactly those features in the x - ray spectra . fortunately , iras f12397 + 3333 had been observed serendipitously , in a long rosat ` pointed ' exposure of a nearby source . we found warm absorber features in the rosat spectrum of this source ( see figure [ rosat ] ) . in order to get a more significant result we had asca observations of this source in 1998 june just a few days before this conference . from a quick look at these new data , we also find warm absorber features in the asca spectra . the details of the rosat and asca data as well as the spectropolarimetry results will be presented in detail ( grupe , leighly & wills ; wills , grupe , leighly & wang in preparation ) . most of the agn we studied have shown polarization @xmath0 1% . this favors a direct , unobscured view to the nucleus . this is in agreement with our finding of no cold absorption of soft x - rays and the flat optical , unreddened spectra and the low balmer decrements . we can therefore rule out the hypothesis that the relatively narrow blr lines found in nlsy1s are a result of obscuration of the inner high velocity blr clouds .    however , the situation in the polarized agn might be different . all those agn have shown high balmer decrements and reddened optical spectra . this suggests that they are affected by dust . their polarization is wavelength dependent . the explanation is that the scattered and therefore polarized light is diluted by a redder unpolarized component . the direct light must go through some dust . we can ask where the scatterers , warm absorbers , and dust are located . the answer to this question may be found by spectropolarimetry . we find that the blr lines are only slightly more polarized than the continuum , but the nlr lines are much less polarized . therefore we can conclude that the dust must be located somewhere between the blr and us , but it does not affect the nlr emission . it must be inside or just outside of the blr . the observation of central soft x - ray emission in these highly reddened agn can be explained by the presence of warm , ionized absorbers . we find those features in the x - ray spectra of our polarized agn . leighly et al . ( 1997 ) have even shown that scattering polarized agn tend to show warm absorber features in their asca data . on the other hand , objects that do not show ` warm ' absorber features in their asca spectra , turn out to be low or unpolarized . asca observations in connection with hst observations of objects that have shown a warm absorber in their asca spectra even reveal uv absorption features  suggesting ionized outflows from agn ( e.g. mathur et al . further studies of these polarized soft x - ray selected agn can help us to understand the structure , kinematics , and physical conditions on scales less than a few pc in agn . with the new upcoming x - ray satellites a more detailed study of the absorption features will be possible to get more information about the kinematics of these absorbers .    we would like to thank prof . dr . k. beuermann ( uni - sternwarte gttingen ) for his support of this study . dg and bjw were supported by a grant from the space telescope science institute ( go-06766 ) and nasa long term space astrophysics grant nag5 - 3431 . this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration . berriman , g. , 1989 , apj 345 , 713 berriman , g. , schmidt , g.d . , west , s.c . , & stockman , h.s . , 1990 , apjs 74 , 869 brandt , w.n . , fabian , a.c . , & pounds , k.a . , 1996 , mnras 278 , 326 brandt , w.n . , mathur , s. , reynolds , c.s . , & elvis , m. , 1997 , mnras 292 , 407 cimatti a. , di serego alighieri s. , fosbury r.e.a . , salvati m. , taylor d. , 1993 , mnras 264 , 421 grupe , d. , beuermann , k. , thomas , h .- c . , mannheim , k. , & fink , h.h . , 1998a , a&a 330 , 25 grupe , d. , beuermann , k. , mannheim , k. , & thomas , h .- c . , 1998b , a&a accepted grupe , d. , wills , b.j . , wills , d. , & beuermann , k. , 1998c , a&a 333 , 827 leighly , k.m . , kay , l.e . , wills , b.j . , wills , d. , & grupe , d. , 1997 , apj 489 , l137 mathur s. , wilkes , b. , aldcroft , t. , 1997 , apj 477 , 93 thomas h .- c . , beuermann k. , reinsch k. , et al . , 1998 , a&a in press voges , w. , aschenbach , b. , boller , th . , et al . , 1998 , a&as in press wills , b.j . , wills , d. , evans , n.j . , et al . , 1992 , apj 400 , 96 "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " we have surveyed the optical linear polarimetric properties of 65 soft x - ray selected rosat active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .   most of these sources show low polarization ( @xmath01% ) and no optical reddening .   this is in agreement with the x - ray results suggesting a direct view on the center .   however , two of our agn show polarization as high as 78% and high reddening .   this optical reddening suggests a high column of dusty gas , but why does this gas not absorb the soft x - rays ?   we suggest that the dusty gas is actually ionized .   there is evidence for these warm absorbers from x - ray absorption features seen in rosat and asca spectra .

( 2000b ) which is similar to that used for grb location by pendleton et al . the estimated peak fluxes above 50  kev were about 0.3 and @xmath9 which is high as compared with the normal flux from cyg x-1 . on april  20 , batse detectors were triggered by another event with right ascension , @xmath10 , and declination , @xmath11 ( batse estimate , note also that this event is identified as a grb in the batse data base ) . again , the location was close to cyg x-1 ( slightly beyond 1@xmath12 error circle ) . and @xmath13 . ] the peak flux of this event was about @xmath14 . on april  21 , the two brightest outbursts occurred , with the interval @xmath15 hours . between and after the two outbursts , cyg x-1 demonstrated nothing unusual , being in the hard state with normal luminosity . the summary of all the five events is given in table  1 . we will concentrate on the two brightest events on april  21 ( two last lines in table  1 ) . the locations of both events coincide with the location of cyg x-1 with 2@xmath16 accuracy . in principle , it might be accidental projections of grbs on cyg x-1 . the probability that one of @xmath17 detected grbs with comparable brightness will appear within 2@xmath16 from cyg x-1 is about 0.3 . however , the probability of appearance of two such grbs from the same location within 2.5 hours is low , @xmath18 . besides , the long duration of the events , @xmath19  s , is very unusual for grbs . one concludes that the events are outbursts of cyg x-1 . table 1 + summary of outbursts on 1999 april 19 - 21    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we then compute the cross - correlation coefficient between channels 2 and 3 , @xmath20 ) ( see table  4 ) . the cross - correlation decreases during the outbursts and becomes very low in interval e. it confirms that the soft component gets so soft that it practically does not contribute to the signal in channel  3 . in interval f , the cross - correlation is high , confirming that the soft component has disappeared and we see only the second ( hard ) component in all the three channels . the luminosities of the soft and hard components can be roughly estimated from the step - like cut offs at 64.05  ks and 64.1  ks , respectively . the average luminosity of cyg  x-1 in time interval e above 50  kev ( 30  kev ) is @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) in the soft component and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) in the hard component . the normal hard state of cyg x-1 was studied using the earth occultations which occur on each orbit of the _ cgro_. the step in the light curve at the moment of occultation shows the amplitude of the signal from cyg x-1 in each energy channel . the study of cyg x-1 with this method was done by ling et al . ( 1997 ) and paciesas et al . we performed a similar analysis for @xmath25 occultations and evaluated the flux from cyg x-1 and the hardness ratio @xmath26 ( ratio of the signal count rates in channels 3 and 2 ) for each occultation . the results are shown in figure  2 . the observed large dispersion in the hardness ratio may be caused by the measurement errors rather than intrinsic variability of cyg  x-1 . to estimate the errors we did a similar analysis of 80 occultations of the crab nebula which is known to be a steady source . we found @xmath27 and the count rate @xmath28 , where the errors represent the standard deviations . the major cause of the errors is the uncertainty in the changing background ( to have good statistics one has to fit the signal on a relatively long period @xmath29 s before and after the occultation , and the background curvature plays a role ) . one should note that the error in the hardness ratio of cyg x-1 is likely to be smaller than that for the crab since its flux is larger . in the outbursts , these errors are even smaller . = 7.5 cm    for comparison we also show the estimates of the flux and hardness ratio for the two april  21 outbursts . note that outburst 11289c and interval f of outburst 11289e have hardness ratios similar to the normal hard state . interval e of outburst 11289e is significantly softer . the presence of two emission components ( soft , highly variable , and hard , with lower variability ) in outburst 11289e is intriguing . are they present in the normal state of cyg  x-1 ? in the sample of 63 occultations we found that the fractional rms of the count rate ( i.e. the ratio of the rms to the mean count rate ) in channel 2 was higher than that in channel 3 in 47 cases . this indicates higher variability in channel 2 ( the probability of such an accidental excess is @xmath30 ) . the decreasing of the variability with energy was also observed in the 240 kev band ( nowak et al . 1999 ; revnivtsev et al . these facts are consistent with the presence of a hard component with a low variability though this interpretation is not unique . note also that gierliski et al . ( 1997 ) got the best fit to the broad - band x - ray spectrum of cyg  x-1 with two thermal comptonization components of different temperatures . the hard state of cyg  x-1 has been a puzzle since its discovery . the standard accretion disk model ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) was not able to explain the x - ray spectrum , and two modifications of the model were suggested : a two - temperature hot disk and an active corona atop the standard disk ( see beloborodov 1999a for a recent review ) . the advective hot - disk models ( e.g. esin et al . 1998 ) are consistent with the observed spectrum and luminosity of cyg x-1 if the accretion rate has a specific value @xmath31 @xmath32 and the viscosity parameter @xmath33 . here @xmath36 @xmath37 is the eddington luminosity . small variations in the accretion rate , @xmath38 , were predicted to destroy the hard state ( esin et al . 1998 ; but see also zdziarski 1998 ) . by contrast , the luminosity of cyg x-1 is known to vary by a factor of two without substantial changes in the spectral shape ( e.g. , paciesas et al . 1997 ; gierliski et al . such fluctuations already challenged the model , and the hard outbursts analyzed in this letter are even more difficult to explain . the model would work only assuming a specific dependence @xmath39 that keeps @xmath40 ; @xmath41 then should be about unity at the peak of the outburst .    in the context of the disk - corona model , the outbursts can be interperted as an enhanced coronal activity of the accretion disk . in this model , the x - ray spectral slope is controlled by one parameter , the feedback factor due to x - ray reprocessing by the disk . the hard - state spectrum of cyg  x-1 is well explained if the coronal plasma is ejected away from the disk with a mildly relativistic velocity @xmath42 ( beloborodov 1999b ; malzac , beloborodov , & poutanen 2001 ) . alternatively , the observed emission may be produced by a static corona atop a strongly ionized disk ( e.g. , ross , fabian , & young 1999 ; nayakshin 1999 ) . the corona becomes @xmath43dominated at high luminosities and its temperature decreases ( e.g. , svensson 1984 ; stern et al . 1995 ; poutanen & svensson 1996 ) . pair creation may cause the shift of the spectral break in outburst 11289e to smaller energies . cyg  x-1 is a massive x - ray binary and it may be fed mainly by the donor wind . then the pattern of accretion can change completely compared to the standard viscous @xmath44disk or its modifications . the captured wind matter has a low angular momentum , just about critical for disk formation ( illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ) . under such conditions , a small - scale inviscid disk forms , which accretes super - sonically ( beloborodov & illarionov 2001 ) . the disk forms in the ring - like caustic of the accretion flow where energy is liberated in inelastic collision of gas streams . a comptonized power - law spectrum is then emitted with a standard break at @xmath29  kev , and it has appearance of a normal hard state of cyg  x-1 . the two - component emission in outburst 11289e probably requires a two - zone emission model . for instance , the soft component may be associated with a variable coronal emission atop the disk , and the hard component with an inner relativistic jet . a corona - jet model was recently proposed by brocksopp et al . ( 1999 ) based on correlations between the x - rays and the radio emission observed in cyg x-1 . the april 1999 outbursts were , however , too short to have a significant impact on the flux in radio and no substantial changes were detected ( r.  fender and g.  pooley , private communication ) . in the context of the wind - fed accretion model , the two - component emission can naturally appear if viscous accretion disk and wind - disk collision are both operating in the source . concluding , the 1999 april 21 outbursts are the brightest events detected from cyg x-1 by batse during 9 years of its operation . the hard x - ray luminosity above 30  kev was in excess of @xmath45 . unfortunately , there are no simultaneous observations in the soft x - rays , so that one can only guess what was the total luminosity . the large luminosity and unusual spectral behavior challenge the theoretical models of accretion in cyg x-1 . we thank rob fender , guy pooley , and jerry bonnell for useful discussions . we are grateful to rob preece and geoff pendleton for providing the code for computing the detector response matrix and an anonymous referee for useful comments that significantly improved the paper . this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center . this work was supported by the swedish natural science research council , the swedish royal academy of sciences , the wenner - gren foundation for scientific research , the anna - greta and holger crafoord fund , and rfbr grant 00 - 02 - 16135 . paciesas , w. s. , robinson , c. r. , mccollough , m. l. , zhang , s. n. , harmon , b. a. , wilson , c. a. 1997 , in aip conf . 410 , proc . of the 4th compton symposium , ed . c. d. dermer , m. s. strickman , & j. m. kurfess ( new york : aip ) , 834                    stern , b. e. , tikhomirova , ya . , kompaneets , d. , stepanov , m. , berezhnoy , a. , & svensson , r. 1999 , in asp conf . ser . 190 , gamma - ray bursts : the first three minutes , ed . j. poutanen , r. svensson ( san francisco : asp ) , 253 "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " a very high activity of cygnus x-1 on 1999 april 19 - 21 was recorded by batse large area detectors onboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro)_. the peak luminosity was one order of magnitude higher than the normal luminosity of cyg x-1 .   this fact can be critical for models of the hard state of cyg x-1 .   the longest outburst lasted @xmath0  s and demonstrated very unusual temporal and spectral behavior which indicates the presence of two emission components .   one component is relatively soft ( with a cutoff below @xmath1 ) and highly variable , and the other one is hard ( extending above 100 kev ) , with much slower variability .

( 2008 , 2009a ) . substantial progress has also been helped by improved observing strategies including targeting pne with suspected post - ce morphologies ( miszalski et al . 2011a ) and the use of less nebula - contaminated filters to obtain lightcurves ( miszalski et al . in addition to the ogle discoveries more close binaries were found by hillwig et al . ( 2010 ) , hajduk et al . ( 2010 ) , corradi et al . ( 2011 ) , santander - garca et al . ( 2011 ) and miszalski et al . ( 2011a , 2011c , 2011d ) . fewer wide binary systems are known and they mostly have chemically peculiar giants or sub - giants ( e.g. bond et al . 2003 ; frew et al . 2011 ; miszalski et al . figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows a selection of these new binaries . the majority of binary central stars discovered have orbital periods less than 1 day ( miszalski et al . 2009a , 2011a ) . this is firm evidence that these systems passed through the poorly understood ce phase ( iben & livio 1993 ) . post - ce pne offer one of the best opportunities to measure the orbital period distribution directly after the ce phase since the nebula guarantees the period is ` fresh ' and has not yet been altered by further angular momentum loss . this is a crucial ingredient for improving ce population synthesis models that currently rely upon a parametric formalism ( see boffin & miszalski 2011 for further discussion ) .    with the excellent sensitivity of the ogle survey miszalski et al . ( 2009a ) determined the close binary fraction in pne to be at least @xmath1% and ruled out the presence of a significant population of binaries with periods greater than @xmath01 day . the most promising aspect of the new discoveries will be the ability to obtain accurate keplerian masses once radial velocity orbits are measured . this will greatly improve our understanding of pn evolution that is currently heavily dependent on models for central star masses . miszalski et al . ( 2009b ) analysed images of an enlarged sample of 30 post - ce pne to find at least 1/3 had canonical bipolar morphologies . the actual bipolar fraction may be as high as 6070% because of inclination effects , but this remains to be proven via kinematic modelling . a large proportion of the sample also showed low - ionisation structures ( lis , gonalves et al . 2001 ) and collimated polar outflows or jets . the lis occur in small knots ( e.g. ds  1 ) , rings of knots ( e.g. the necklace ) or in more extreme configurations ( e.g. ngc  6326 ) and may be produced by a photoionising wind interacting with dust and gas placed in the orbital plane during the ce phase . if this scenario is correct , then the uncanny resemblance between sn1987a and the necklace may imply a binary progenitor was responsible for the bipolar nebula and ring of knots seen in sn1987a ( see e.g. boffin & miszalski 2011 ) . the extreme set of knots in ngc  6326 also suggest a binary origin for morphologically similar features in a  30 ( miszalski et al . 2011d ) . jets are prominent in a  63 , the necklace and ethos  1 providing the first clear evidence for a binary origin of these features ( soker & livio 1994 ) . kinematics of these nebulae show the jets are older than the main nebula , suggesting that they were launched by a temporary accretion disk around the companion established during or prior to the ce phase . such a configuration also explains why the jets in post - ce pne are not highly collimated due to orbital motion and precession ( see e.g. raga et al . some of these systems were successfully discovered by pre - selecting for these nebula trends ( miszalski et al . 2011a ) , however a much larger campaign is needed to verify these initial results . it has long been known that close binary central stars , consisting of a white dwarf primary and a main sequence secondary , display narrow emission lines of c  iii , n  iii and c  iv originating near an irradiated zone on the secondary ( e.g. pollacco & bell 1994 ) . miszalski et al . ( 2011c , 2011d ) emphasised the real overlap between the orbit - dependent irradiated emission and the so - called `` weak emission line '' central stars ( _ wels _ , tylenda et al . wels _ could therefore turn out to be close binary stars if high quality time - series spectroscopy were to reveal radial velocity shifts in these lines and confirmed by periodic lightcurves . this would go a large way towards explaining the _ wels _ which do not fit any central star classification schemes ( mndez 1991 ; crowther et al . those which are not found to be close binaries might be classified as [ wn / wc ] ( todt et al . 2010 ) or [ wc]-pg1159 ( parthasarathy et al . 1998 ) .    in summary , the _ wels _ are a description of spectroscopic features and not a stellar classification to be used in central star catalogues . in close binaries the weak emission lines do not originate from the primary , as proven by ngc  6326 ( miszalski et al . 2011d ) , and therefore can not be considered for the basis for any classification . if not a close binary , then the object should be left as unclassified or assigned into the [ wn / wc ] or [ wc]-pg1159 class if there is sufficient supporting information . analysis of new examples befitting these latter classes will be presented elsewhere . in the sample of known close binaries only ngc  6778 ( miszalski et al . 2011d ) shows type - i chemical abundances ( perinotto et al . the high he / h and n / o ratios seen have long been considered to be only produced by progenitors massive enough to experience hot bottom burning ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) , however in this case we may be seeing an alternative close binary channel to produce type - i pne ( karakas et al . 2009 ; karakas & lugaro 2010 ) . keplerian masses of ngc  6778 and future expected discoveries will shed much greater insight into the origin of type - i pne than hitherto possible .    the level of s - process enrichment in nebulae ( sterling & dinerstein 2008 ) and barium central stars ( e.g. bond et al . 2003 ; miszalski et al . 2011e ) is also a valuable tool to further understand type - i pne ( see also karakas & lugaro , these proceedings ) . work so far suggests that binarity or some other process may be reducing the s - process enrichment in type - i pne , although the binary fraction of the sterling & dinerstein ( 2008 ) sample is yet to be determined . abell 70 is a particularly interesting case since it is a s - process enhanced g8iv - v companion and shows type - i abundances at @xmath02 kpc below the galactic plane , far away from where massive progenitors are expected ( miszalski et al . the central stars of three peculiar pne are known to show r coronae borealis - like dust obscuration events : ngc  2346 ( mndez et al . 1982 ) , hen  3 - 1333 ( cohen et al . 2002 ) and m  2 - 29 ( hajduk et al . 2008 ) . miszalski et al . ( 2011b ) showed that the quasi - periodic events are not triggered by a binary companion interacting at periastron , but rather occur at the inner edge of a dust disk at @xmath0100 au ( e.g. chesneau et al . such dust disks are however thought to depend upon binaries for their formation ( van winckel et al . 2009 ; chesneau 2011 ) . so far only ngc  2346 has been proven to be a binary . miszalski et al . ( 2011b ) proved that the galactic bulge pn m  2 - 29 does not have a close binary central star as previously claimed and suggested instead that an unobserved yellow subgiant may be present to account for the d-type symbiotic star features . balick , b. , & frank , a.  2002 , ara&a , 40 , 439 boffin , h.  m.  j. , & miszalski , b.  2011 , arxiv:1108.0389 bond , h.  e. , & livio , m.  1990 , apj , 355 , 568 bond , h.  e.  2000 , asymmetrical planetary nebulae ii , 199 , 115 bond , h.  e. , pollacco , d.  l. , & webbink , r.  f.  2003 , aj , 125 , 260 chesneau , o. , et al . 2006 , a&a , 455 , 1009 chesneau , o.  2011 , asymmetric planetary nebulae v , arxiv:1010.1081 cohen , m. , barlow , m.  j. , liu , x .- w . , & jones , a.  f.  2002 , mnras , 332 , 879 corradi , r.  l.  m. , et al . 2011 , mnras , 410 , 1349 crowther , p.  a. , de marco , o. , & barlow , m.  j.  1998 , mnras , 296 , 367 frew , d.  j. , et al . 2011 , pasa , 28 , 83 gonalves , d.  r. , corradi , r.  l.  m. , & mampaso , a.  2001 , apj , 547 , 302 hillwig , t.  c. , bond , h.  e. , afar , m. , & de marco , o.  2010 , aj , 140 , 319 hajduk , m. , zijlstra , a.  a. , & gesicki , k.  2008 , a&a , 490 , l7 hajduk , m. , zijlstra , a.  a. , & gesicki , k.  2010 , mnras , 406 , 626 iben , i.  j. , & livio , m.  1993 , pasp , 105 , 1373 jacoby , g.  h. , kronberger , m. , patchick , d. , et al . 2010 , pasa , 27 , 156 karakas , a.  i. , et al . 2009 , apj , 690 , 1130 karakas , a.  i. , & lugaro , m.  2010 , pasa , 27 , 227 karakas , a.  i. , & lugaro , m.  2011 , iaus , 283 manchado , a. , et al . 1996 , the iac morphological catalog of northern galactic pne mndez , r.  h. , gathier , r. , & niemela , v.  s.  1982 , a&a , 116 , l5 mndez , r.  h.  1991 , evolution of stars : the photospheric abundance connection , 145 , 375 miranda , l.  f. , ramos - larios , g. , & guerrero , m.  a.  2010 , pasa , 27 , 180 miszalski , b. , acker , a. , moffat , a.  f.  j. , parker , q.  a. , & udalski , a.  2008 , a&a , 488 , l79 miszalski , b. , acker , a. , moffat , a.  f.  j. , parker , q.  a. , & udalski , a.  2009a , a&a , 496 , 813 miszalski , b. , acker , a. , parker , q.  a. , & moffat , a.  f.  j.  2009b , a&a , 505 , 249 miszalski , b. , et al .  2011a , asymmetric planetary nebulae v , arxiv:1009.2890 miszalski , b. , et al . 2011b , a&a , 528 , a39 miszalski , b. , et al . 2011c , mnras , 413 , 1264 miszalski , b. , et al . 2011d , a&a , 531 , a158 miszalski , b. , et al . 2011e , mnras , in press , arxiv:1108.3957 parthasarathy , m. , acker , a. , & stenholm , b.  1998 , a&a , 329 , l9 perinotto , m. , morbidelli , l. , & scatarzi , a.  2004 , mnras , 349 , 793 pollacco , d.  l. , & bell , s.  a.  1994 , mnras , 267 , 452 raga , a.  c. , esquivel , a. , velzquez , p.  f. , et al . 2009 , apjl , 707 , l6 sahai , r. , morris , m.  r. , & villar , g.  g.  2011 , aj , 141 , 134 santander - garcia , m. , et al .  2011 , asymmetric planetary nebulae v , arxiv:1009.3055 soker , n. , & livio , m.  1994 , apj , 421 , 219 sterling , n.  c. , & dinerstein , h.  l.  2008 , apjs , 174 , 158 todt , h. , pea , m. , hamann , w .- r . , & grfener , g.  2010 , a&a , 515 , a83 tylenda , r. , acker , a. , & stenholm , b.  1993 , a&as , 102 , 595 udalski , a.  2009 , astronomical society of the pacific conference series , 403 , 110 van winckel , h. , et al . 2009 , a&a , 505 , 1221 "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": " binary central stars have long been invoked to explain the vexing shapes of planetary nebulae ( pne ) despite there being scant direct evidence to support this hypothesis .   modern large - scale surveys and improved observing strategies have allowed us to significantly boost the number of known close binary central stars and estimate at least 20% of pne have close binary nuclei that passed through a common - envelope ( ce ) phase . the larger sample of post - ce nebulae appears to have a high proportion of bipolar nebulae , low - ionisation structures ( especially in sn1987a - like rings ) and polar outflows or jets .   these trends are guiding our target selection in ongoing multi - epoch spectroscopic and photometric surveys for new binaries .   multiple new discoveries are being uncovered that further strengthen the connection between post - ce trends and close binaries .   these ongoing surveys also have wider implications for understanding ce evolution , low - ionisation structure and jet formation , spectral classification of central stars , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) nucleosynthesis and dust obscuration events in pne .

[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] is the observed faraday rotation as a function of wavelength for samples 7 and 8 , respectively . note that both films have maximum rotation near 2.45 ev , a feature characteristic of all the films considered in this study . in fact , all the films exhibit the same spectral shape , with only minor deviations from that seen in figs . [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .    in order to understand the behaviour of the spectra , we have adopted the theory developed in refs.@xcite . here the expression for the faraday rotation is given by @xmath13^{2 } + 4\\omega^{2}\\gamma_{i}^{2 } } - \\frac{(\\omega_{i}-\\delta_{i})^{2}-\\omega^{2}-\\gamma_{i}^{2}}{\\left[(\\omega_{i}-\\delta_{i})^{2}-\\omega^{2}+\\gamma_{i}^{2}\\right]^{2 } + 4\\omega^{2}\\gamma_{i}^{2 } } \\right\\ } \\,\\,\\ ,   , \\label{far } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 represent the resonance energy , @xmath15 the oscillator strength , while @xmath16 is the half - linewidth of the transition . furthermore , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the electron charge and mass , respectively , whereas @xmath19 is the active ion density .    for @xmath20 it is reasonable to assume that @xmath19 is directly proportional to the bismuth content @xmath21@xcite . furthermore , it is known that the strong enhancement of faraday rotation is caused by iron - pair transitions , involving both octahedral and tetrahedral transitions simultaneously@xcite . therefore , iron dilution of either sublattice results in a reduction of the active ion density . for these reasons we assume that the active ion density can be written as@xcite @xmath22 @xmath23 is a constant , and may expected to be 1/3 of the density of rare - earth ions on the dodecahedral site , i.e. @xmath24 @xmath25 . when @xmath26 , this interpretation implies that the dodecahedral site is fully occupied by bismuth .    to fit theoretical curves to the experimental data , the product @xmath27 was chosen as free parameter the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 were chosen as sample independent , and the values suggested in ref . @xcite were used as a starting point in the fitting . table ii presents the paremeters found to give the best fit between the theoretical curves and experimental data . note that our values for @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 differs slightly from those used in ref . this is due to the fact that in that paper we focused on obtaining a very good fit for energies less than 2.3 ev . however , this resulted in some deviations between experiment and theory near the maximum faraday rotation . here we have chosen parameters which give the best agreement within the whole range of experimental data . the solid line shown in fig . [ f1 ] is the faraday rotation calculated from eq . ( [ far ] ) using the values in table ii . the dashed and dash - dotted lines show the contribution to the total faraday rotation from the octahedral and tetrahedral sites , respectively . note that below 2.2 ev , the main contribution to @xmath31 comes from the octahedral site .    the solid line in fig . [ f2 ] shows the calculated faraday rotation of sample 8 . again , we note that the theoretical curve is in good agreement with the experimental data . also shown is the theoretical predictions when the bismuth content is x=1.5 ( dashed line ) . in this case one may expect almost 7 @xmath32 at 2.3 ev . it is useful to find out how bismuth and gallium influences the faraday rotation . to this end , we define the following parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 here @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the faraday rotations associated with the bismuth and gallium content , respectively . the experimental data and theoretical curves for these two parameters are plotted in figs . [ f3 ] and [ f4 ] , respectively . the good agreement between experimental data and theoretical predictions confirm the validity of the model used here . if a light beam propagates along the z - axis through the magnetic film , then the polar faraday rotation of the film is given by ( neglecting the voigt - effect and multiple reflections)@xcite @xmath37 where the anisotropy field is defined by @xmath38 eq . ( [ f ] ) is only valid as long as the cubic anisotropy can be neglected . when @xmath39 , the faraday rotation is at its maximum value . as an example , the faraday rotation as a function of @xmath40 for sample 4 is shown in fig . note that the faraday rotation is accurately described by eq . ( [ f ] ) as long as @xmath41 . in fig . [ f6 ] the experimental values for @xmath42 is displayed as a function of gallium substitition . the dashed line shows the best fit to @xmath42 for films with composition @xmath43 @xmath44 also shown is the value for @xmath45 found in the litterature@xcite @xmath46 the experimental values for @xmath42 are quite close to eq . ( [ ms ] ) , which indicates that the uniaxial anisotropy plays a minor role here . since the films of composition @xmath43 are well described by eq . ( [ ha ] ) , we will use this in the further modelling . film 7 , 8 and 12 are not well described by eq . ( [ ha ] ) , which is most probably due to their chemical composition . the faraday rotation sensitivity is given by @xmath47 it is useful to separate the contributions from bismuth and gallium . the contribution from bismuth can be written as @xmath48 the experimental data at 2.3 ev ( wavelength 540 nm ) are shown in fig . [ f7 ] together with the theoretical prediction based on eq . ( [ bi ] ) . a reasonably good agreement is obtained for all samples of composition @xmath43 , except sample 11 , which shows a minor deviation from the theoretical curve . we do not know the reason for this deviation . it is interesting to observe that the sensitivity depends linearly on the bismuth content . the experimental data for samples 7 , 8 and 12 ( diamond , circle and cross ) are located far from the straight line , since they do not follow eq . ( [ ha ] ) . it is also of interest to see how gallium influences the sensitivity of the material . to that end , we define @xmath49 in fig .

[ the - model - system ] , we describe the model system . a definition of `` void '' and an algorithm to compute void statistics is given in sec . [ voids ] . the results of numerical simulations and their relevance in lipid biomembranes is discussed in sec . [ results - and - discussion ] we summarize the paper in sec . [ summary ] . the configuration space of the model system ( membrane ) is considered as a two dimensional space with periodic ( toroidal ) boundary conditions . the constituents of the membrane are disks and dopants . we consider a membrane made up of only circular disks interacting pairwise via the _ lennard - jones _ potential : @xmath0 where , @xmath1 is the distance between the centers of the @xmath2 and @xmath3 disks , @xmath4 determines the range of hard core part in the potential and @xmath5 signifies the depth of the attractive part . we choose the number of disks such that the area occupied by these disks is around @xmath6 , which is less than that of the close - packed structure but still large enough to produce some closed voids . further , we consider different _ shape anisotropic _ combinations ( dopants ) consisting of @xmath7 number of circular disks . we treat each of these combinations as a single rigid cluster . several such dopants ( impurities ) are considered . 1 shows some of these impurities . the interaction between impurities and disks or other impurities is obtained by superposing the _ lennard - jones _ potential corresponding to each of the constituent disk in impurity . we consider a membrane with circular disks and impurities amounting to @xmath8 of the total number of circular disks , such that the area occupied is still @xmath6 . these membranes are brought to an equilibrium configuration by the monte carlo method  @xcite at a fixed temperature . fig . 2 and fig . 3 show typical equilibrium configurations of membrane without and with impurities respectively ( the impurity in fig . 3 is a rod shaped structure made up of five disks ( rod@xmath9 ) , in general rod@xmath10 for rod made up of @xmath7 number of disks ) . in the simulation the temperature is so chosen that @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the _ boltzmann _ constant . the equilibrium is confirmed by simulated annealing . now , we introduce the notion of an `` @xmath13-void '' in a membrane which is suitable for the description of transport across membrane and further , propose an algorithm to compute statistical quantities such as the number of voids in the membrane , the void size distribution etc . we define an @xmath13-void as a closed area in a membrane devoid of disks or impurities , and big enough to accommodate a circular disk of radius @xmath13 . of course an @xmath13-void is also an @xmath14-void if @xmath15 .      to compute the void statistics for @xmath13-voids , we increase the radii of the disks forming the membrane ( including the disks in the impurities , without altering the positions of the centers ) by an amount @xmath13 ( see fig . then we digitize the entire membrane on a suitably chosen grid . the choice of grid size depends on the required accuracy and the typical sizes of the voids . the digitization of circular disks is carried out by the bressenham circle drawing algorithm  @xcite , modified to incorporate periodic boundary conditions . the number of voids in the membrane are computed by flood filling  @xcite every closed void with a different color and then counting the number of colors . the sizes of various voids can be obtained by counting the number of grid - cells filled by the corresponding color . the termination of flood fill algorithm is ensured since the voids are closed . in our case this condition is automatically fulfilled in view of periodic boundary conditions . the geometric algorithms involving vorenoi polygons  @xcite are mathematically satisfying and are expected to be accurate but would take much more computation time . on the other hand , as pointed in  @xcite , the probabilistic algorithm is time efficient but requires a very large sample size while dealing with small voids . our algorithm is quite efficient as well as suitable even when there are small voids in the membrane . we further note that the algorithm can be easily generalized to higher dimensions . we expect that the efficiency of this algorithm can be further enhanced by the use of a multi - resolution adaptive grid . the simulations were carried out for membranes of different compositions . fig . 5 shows the graphs of the number of @xmath13-voids as a function of @xmath13 measured in units of the radius of the constituent disks . curve ( a ) shows void distribution in absence of impurities . curve ( b ) represents the void distribution in a membrane with rod shaped impurities made up of two disks ( rod@xmath16 ) . curves ( c ) and ( d ) show the void distribution with l shaped impurities made up of four disks ( l@xmath17 ) and rod like impurities made up of four disks ( rod@xmath17 ) respectively . it is clear from the graph that the number of large voids increases with an increase in the anisotropy of the impurity . even though l@xmath17 and rod@xmath17 occupy the same area , rod@xmath17 being more anisotropic induces a larger number of big voids than l@xmath17 . this fact can be clearly seen in fig . 5 , curves ( c ) and ( d ) . moreover , the fig . 2 and fig . 3 demonstrate the fact that the voids are mostly found in the neighborhood of the centers of anisotropy further , to strengthen our claim that the shape anisotropy induces voids , we compared two membranes . in one case we added rod impurities made up of two disks ( rod@xmath16 ) in the assembly of circular disks , and in the other case we added circular impurities of larger size , which occupied the same area as that of rod@xmath16 . we found that the former , being more anisotropic , induced larger and more numerous voids as compared to the later , though they occupied the same area . thus , reduced to the bare essentials , the anisotropy in the interaction potential of the constituents , is seen to be responsible for the induction of large voids . if studied from the perspective of energy minimization , as the potential becomes direction dependent , some positions of the constituents are preferred over the other positions . this induces large voids . these features show a remarkable similarity with the observations reported in certain biological experiments  @xcite . these experiments deal with the size - dependent permeation of non - electrolytes across biological membranes . the effect of doping on the permeation of large molecules was studied in these experiments . the liposome - membrane used in these experiments was made up of mixture of two types of lipids ( cardiolipins and phosphatidylcholine ) in a proportion 1:10 . the understanding of the enhancement of transport in doped membranes needed an algorithmic statement . the ingredients at the algorithmic level involved :    1 . consideration of the structure as a strictly 2dimensional assembly 2 . the cross sections of molecules being considered as constituents 3 . interactions of the constituents via the lennard jones potential 4 .   permeating particles being considered as hard disks . the features reported in  @xcite bear a similarity with the simulation carried out with rod@xmath16 as dopants . we have already seen in numerical simulations ( see fig . 5 , curves ( a ) and ( b ) ) that the rod@xmath16 type of impurities induced large voids in the membrane . the appearance of larger voids naturally enhances the transport of large particles . thus an enhancement in the transport of large non - electrolytes like glucose , which was observed in the lipid mixture  @xcite can possibly be understood using our simple approach . further , apart from the biological implications , the model discussed is general enough to incorporate the studies of transport in various weakly bound granular media . we have presented a numerical algorithm to compute the entire void statistics in a two dimensional membrane consisting of circular disks and dopants . we found that our simple two dimensional model has shown results consistent with features observed in a complex biological system . the biological justification of the model and implications are discussed elsewhere  @xcite . nevertheless , our model and the proposed numerical algorithm which finds out the void statistics in the model system are quite general and use no specific features of any particular system . therefore it is possible to use this method effectively in various systems from diverse disciplines . the result that the shape anisotropy induces large voids in mixtures may be used as a tool for achieving controlled selective permeability across such a system by merely changing the shape of the constituents of the mixture . fig . 1 : :    some examples of the impurities . +    ( a ) ; ;      rod type impurity made up of three circles ( rod@xmath18 ) .

energy emission originates . vlbi monitoring of agn jets is the only way to directly measure their relativistic motion and calculate intrinsic jet parameters . vlbi observations let us probe the conditions under which blazars and non - blazars emit @xmath1-rays . the tanami ( * * t**racking * * a**ctive galactic * * n**uclei with * * a**ustral * * m**illiarcsecond * * i**nterferometry ) program ( @xcite ) provides parsec scale resolution monitoring of extragalactic gamma -

dish resolution radio monitoring with the hobart and ceduna telescopes of the university of tasmania ( pi : j. lovell ) . tanami began observations in november 2007 with an initial sample of 43 sources consisting of a radio selected flux - density limited subsample and a @xmath1-ray selected subsample of known and candidate egret detections . this initial sample has since been expanded to include new detections by the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ) . details of the sample and observations are presented in @xcite . here we outline some early results from the tanami program . mjy beam@xmath2 . the hatched ellipse on the bottom left shows the restoring beam of @xmath3 mas at @xmath4.,width=264 ]    on september 4th , 2008 , a strong @xmath1-ray flare was detected by the large area telescope ( lat ) coming from the direction of the flat - spectrum radio quasar pks1454@xmath5354 ( @xmath6 ) . this quasar was a possible counterpart of the unidentified egret source 3eg j1500@xmath53509 @xcite . the flux rose on a timescale of hours before dropping over the following two days . tanami images provided the first high - resolution , high - sensitivity parsec - scale image of the blazar jet for the first lat agn paper reporting this detection and its multi - wavelength follow - up @xcite . figure  [ 1454 ] shows a naturally weighted image of pks1454@xmath5354 observed at 8.4ghz on nov 10th , 2007 . the image achieves a resolution of @xmath3 mas at an rms noise of @xmath7 mjy beam@xmath2 . it shows a compact core and a single - sided jet extending to @xmath8 mas at a position angle of @xmath9 , confirming the activity of this source . model fitting the core with an elliptical gaussian yields a brightness temperature limit of @xmath10k . the activity of this source continues to be monitored by tanami at unprecedented resolution and dynamic range . at a distance of 3.4 mpc @xcite , centaurus a is the closest known radio galaxy making it possible to study it at subparsec scales . not surprisingly , it has been extensively observed at many wavelengths and its basic vlbi - scale radio structure is well - known to consist of a bright jet and a faint counter - jet at a viewing angle of @xmath11 degrees @xcite . the tanami program has produced one of the highest resolution images of an agn jet ever made @xcite . the uniformly weighted beam with a resolution of @xmath12mas happens to be comparable to the resolution ( @xmath13mas ) of the previous highest resolution image of this object @xcite . though these observations are separated by about a decade the structures are remarkably similar which would appear to be contrary to the previously reported apparent velocity of @xmath14mas @xcite . velocity information obtained from continuing multi - epoch tanami observations is being used to investigate this . figure  [ cena_x ] and figure  [ cena_k ] show the core region from naturally weighted images of centaurus a at 8.4ghz and 22ghz respectively . in both cases the data have been self - calibrated using the clean algorithm and the clean components in the final model have been replaced by gaussian model components in order to parametrize the core region . there is close agreement between these two figures suggesting that the `` core '' has the same size at both frequencies . due to the presence of trans - oceanic baselines to the tigo ( chile ) and ohiggins ( antarctica ) telescopes only at 8.4ghz , the lower frequency image has the higher resolution , resolving the core and providing the finest view of the putative @xmath1-ray production region seen so far . these simultaneous dual - frequency data are part of a set of simultaneous broadband data being used to model the behavior of centaurus a @xcite . first epoch images at 8.4ghz of all 43 sources in the initial tanami sample have been analyzed and the results are presented in @xcite . the images have high dynamic range and are often the best and sometimes the first images of an agn at milliarcsecond scale resolution . here we conclude this presentation with a few highlights from this analysis . unless explicitly stated all discussions below are made with reference to the lat 3-month list @xcite .    * * morphology and the _ fermi _ connection * + figure  [ firstepoch ] shows four sources which represent the four morphological classes we have classified the tanami sample into . all the images are made with naturally weighted , 8.4ghz data . the axes are labeled in units of milliarcseconds . the restoring beam of each image is shown as a hatched ellipse on the bottom left and , for the three sources that have known redshifts , a bar indicating a linear scale of 10pc or 1pc is shown on the bottom right . the root - mean - square ( rms ) noise in the images is typically about @xmath15 mjy beam@xmath2 . the lowest contour level is at 3 times the root - mean - square noise level . + the classification scheme we have adopted is that of @xcite which makes no assumptions about the physical nature of the objects thus separating their description from their interpretation . clockwise from the top left , are examples of single - sided ( ss ) , compact ( c ) , double - sided ( ds ) and irregular ( irr ) morphology . the initial tanami sample has 33 ss sources and 5 ds sources with just one example each of the other two morphological types . three sources do not have an optical identification . all of the quasars and bl lacertae objects in the sample have an ss morphology while all 5 ds sources are galaxies . the lone c source is optically unidentified while the only irr source is a gps galaxy 1718@xmath5649 which is tentatively detected by lat @xcite . +         + in its first three months of operation _ fermi _ detected 12 of 43 tanami sources with @xmath16 significance . all but one of these sources are quasars and bllacertae objects with an ss morphology ( the exception is the nearby radio galaxy centaurus a ) . this accords well with the canonical view that quasars and bl lacertae objects have an intrinsically symmetric twin - jet structure that is transformed by differential doppler boosting to the observed core - jet morphology . * * are opening angles correlated with @xmath1 luminosity ? * + given the expectation that the @xmath1-ray emission from agn is beamed and thus orientation dependent , a link between @xmath1-ray emission and the parsec scale morphology of agn has been sought ( e.g. @xcite ) . we fit circular gaussians to the visibility data and measured the angle at which the innermost jet component appears relative to the position of the core i.e. the opening angle . of the lat agn bright sample ( lbas ) sources @xmath17 have an opening angle @xmath18 degrees while only @xmath19 of non - lbas sources do . in other words , @xmath1-ray bright jets are pointed closer to the line of sight than @xmath1-ray faint jets . this result should be treated with great caution as the sample size for this analysis is currently small but @xcite report similar results . + if confirmed the above result presents two possibilities : either the lbas jets have smaller lorentz factors ( since the width of the relativistic beaming cone @xmath20 ) or lbas jets are pointed closer to the line of sight . the former scenario appears unlikely , indeed the opposite effect is reported by @xcite . * * redshift distribution * + the redshift distribution of the quasars and bllacs in the tanami sample is similar to those for the lbas and egret blazars . there does not appear to be any significant difference between the radio- and @xmath1-ray selected subsamples . * * brightness temperature * + the core brightness temperature ( @xmath21 ) limit of all initial tanami sources was calculated . the high end of the distribution of calculated brightness temperatures is dominated by quasars and the low end by bllacertae objects and galaxies . of the 43 sources in the sample , 13 have a maximum @xmath21 below the equipartition value of @xmath22 k @xcite , 29 below the inverse compton limit of @xmath23 k @xcite , putting about a third of the values above this limit . doppler boosting is the most likely reason behind these high values though a variety of exotic mechanisms are also possible . there is no significant difference in the brightness temperature distribution of lbas and non - lbas sources . many of the highest brightness temperature sources are not detected by lat yet which is counterintuitive since they are expected to have higher doppler factors . * * luminosities * + the core and the total luminosity was calculated for all 38 initial tanami sources that had published redshifts , assuming isotropic emission . there is no significant difference in the distribution of luminosities of lbas and non - lbas sources . on the other hand , there is a clear relationship between luminosity and optical type with quasars dominating the high luminosity end of the distribution , galaxies dominating the low luminosity end while the bl lacertae objects fall in between , + none of the five most distant and most luminous sources have been detected by fermi in its first 3 months of operation . intriguingly , none of the nine most luminous jets ( difference of total and core luminosities ) are detected . if this persists it would suggest a completely unexpected anti - correlation between jet luminosity and @xmath1-brightness . the tanami program is providing high quality , high resolution radio monitoring for the southern third of the sky . such data is a crucial member of the suite of multiwavelength observations that is set to revolutionize our understanding of the physics of agn in the era of _ fermi_.    data from the tanami program is already a part of several individual agn studies and statistical analysis of the growing sample of tanami sources is providing insight into the nature and origin of high energy radiation from agn . the availability of core and jet component spectra as well as proper motions is going to greatly expand the questions that tanami can help answer . we are grateful to dirk behrend , neil gehrels , julie mcenery , david murphy , and john reynolds , who contributed in various ways to the success of the tanami program so far . furthermore , we thank the _ fermi_/lat agn group for the good collaboration . this research has been partially funded by the bundesministerium fr wirtschaft und technologie under deutsches zentrum fr luft- und raumfahrt grant number 50or0808 . this research has made use of the united states naval observatory ( usno ) radio reference frame image database ( rrfid ) . this research has made use of data from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned , operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ) ; and the simbad database ( operated at cds , strasbourg , france ) . this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system .

based tasks . in particular , the unstable motion also inhibits higher level vision tasks , such as detecting and tracking of objects in the video . while significant work has been done for handheld cameras and ground vehicles , there are limited works for stabilization of videos taken from uav in the literature . moreover , the existing uav video stabilization algorithms , can not be applied on - board uav systems in real - time .        in general , uav video stabilization algorithms ( @xcite ) follow three main steps : ( 1 ) motion estimation , ( 2 ) motion compensation and ( 3 ) image composition as indicated in figure [ figure : vsworkflow ] . most methods revolve around finding the 2d motion model ( such as homography ) to estimate the global motion trajectory . then a low - pass filter is applied to the trajectory to sieve out the high frequency jitters . then the low frequency parameters are then applied onto frames via warping . this framework is really effective for scenes with very little dynamic movement which is applicable to aerial videos taken by uavs . however , estimating the global motion trajectory using a window of frames can not achieve instantaneous stabilization , as required for real - time processing .    in @xcite , a video stabilization algorithm for uav was proposed using a circular block to search and match key places . the estimated affine transform was then smoothed by the polynomial fitting and prediction method ( pfpm ) . however , this approach only achieved a speed of less than 10fps on a desktop with 3.0ghz processor and 1 gb ram for images with resolution of 216x300p .    in @xcite , a smoothing method utilizes lucas - kanade tracker(@xcite ) to detect interest points . the unintended motion compensation was accomplished by adjusting for extra rotation and displacements that generate vibrations . this approach is able to achieve a stabilizing speed between 20fps and 28fps for images with resolution of 320x240 pixels on a mac laptop with 2.16ghz intel core 2 duo processor with a three frame delay . @xcite , later proposed a three - step video stabilization method for uavs . firstly , a fast corner detector is employed to locate the feature points in the frames . secondly , the matched key - points are used for estimation of affine transform to reduce false matches . finally , motion estimation is performed based on the affine model and the compensation for vibration is conducted based on spline smoothing . it was reported that this algorithm can process up to 30fps on a workstation with an intel xeon 2.26 ghz processor and 6 gb ram for images with resolution of 320240 pixels . a very recent work by @xcite is able to process a 640x480 pixels video at a speed of 40fps on a notebook computer with a 2.5ghz intel duo core cpu . while it is able to achieve a high processing speed , the improvement comes at the price of unreliable motion estimation , which leads to failure in stabilizing the video ultimately . moreover , the algorithm proposed does not furnish evidence for real - time processing on real - time on - board systems . it is noted that these previous methods work offline or in a post - process way . for some uav vision tasks , frames are required to be stabilized immediately and be presented to other tasks , such as object tracking and detection .    the proposed method in this paper is closely related to the method proposed by ho ( @xcite ) . the algorithm employs finding corners in frames , followed by estimating a 2d motion model between consecutive frames . then the parameters in motion model are treated as trajectory to be smoothed using an averaging window . this smoothing of the motion model parameters is different from the motion trajectory smoothing employed by previous works ( @xcite ) . our framework is similar to nghia ho s but has a significant difference in terms of implementation and performance . most notably , a novel hybrid mechanism for motion estimation and an optical flow - based corner tracker has been proposed to overcome the challenges encountered by previous algorithms . in addition , the proposed stabilization algorithm performs in real - time , whereas nghia ho s algorithm processes the whole video sequence before achieving stabilization . the rest of this paper is structured as follows . in section 2 , we introduce the proposed framework for video stabilization . then in section 3 , we discuss how the processing speed of motion estimation is expedited by using an optical flow - based corner tracker and a reduced region of interest . then in section 4 , we explain the improvisation of the motion estimation given by optical flow - based tracker with hybrid motion estimation mechanism . following which , we verify the speed of the algorithm on publicly available uav videos and achieve a speed faster than the current state - of - the - art algorithm . in section 5 , we discuss the implementation of the real - time component of the algorithm using multi - thread processing . finally , we conclude the paper in section 6 . spurred by the challenge to meet the real - time requirements , we propose a novel stabilization framework as shown in figure [ figure : novelworkflow ] . the idea is to build an appropriate model for the global motion trajectory of the uav camera , estimate the motion parameters between two successive frames using very efficient key point detector and compensate the motion via an effective optical flow based tracking of the key points . firstly , the key novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in the high speed estimation of the motion parameter trajectory between two consecutive frames , which other methods are less efficient in accomplishing . this is because the motion estimation phase chooses an appropriate lower order homography , either rigid or similarity transformation between frames . this is so that the algorithm is able to frequently use lower order of homography to estimate the motion parameters unless there is a need to use higher order . as a result , achieving a high processing speed . secondly , our motion compensation phase smooths the parameters via an averaging window . lastly , we warp the frame according to the smoothed parameters . the program is able to process up to 100 frames per second for all 3 stages of the algorithm . this reassures us that the algorithm is suited for real - time video stabilization . after achieving such a high speed in stabilizing the frames , the real - time version of the algorithm can be implemented . the three stages of video stabilization were separated into three different threads . threads are basically independent processes that can run concurrently and share the same resources inside a program . our algorithm is implemented such that motion estimation thread , motion compensation thread and image composition thread are synchronized in such a way that they are able to stabilize a uav video in real time . in other words , there is no need to wait for the processing for the whole video to be done . motion estimation is the very first step in video stabilization and it is also the most time consuming step . consequently , our primary goal is to cut down the time required to calculate the motion parameters trajectory between consecutive frames in the video . the motion trajectory is estimated from how the feature points ( @xcite ) move between consecutive frames . therefore , to initialize motion estimation , we first efficiently detect feature points . feature points are locations in the image with large variations in intensity in all directions . they are very important in motion estimation step as they determine the quality of the motion estimation . one early attempt to find these corners was done by chris harris and mike stephens in their paper ( @xcite ) , which now is called harris corner detector . it basically finds the difference in intensity for a displacement of ( u , v ) in all directions . this can be easily expressed as below . @xmath0}^2 } }   \\label{eq : harriscornerdetector}\\ ] ]    where w ( x , y ) is either a rectangular window or gaussian window function which gives weight to the surrounding pixels . in 1994 , @xcite made a small modification to it in their paper which shows better results compared to harris corner detector . the scoring function in shi - tomasi corner detector is given by :    @xmath1    *  when @xmath2 is small , which happens when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are small , the region is flat . *  when @xmath5 , which happens when @xmath3 @xmath6 @xmath4 vice versa , the region is edge . *  when @xmath5 is large , which happens when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are large and @xmath3   @xmath4 , the region is a corner .    since the proposed idea is to ensure that the algorithm is able to run in real - time , a simple experiment of mosaic was conducted . its purpose is to find out if the number of key points detected has a huge effect on the estimated transformation parameters and also to find out how the time is affected when the number of key points returned is scaled up .    in this experiment , two images of the same scene will be stitched together with a reference image as shown in figure [ fig : mosaic ] .

( [ evolve1 ] ) and ( [ evolve2 ] ) , one can find that the qubits a@xmath10 and b@xmath10 disentangle with the qubits a@xmath11 and b@xmath11 . interestingly , by removing the qubits a@xmath10 and b@xmath10 , the remained qubits a@xmath11 and b@xmath11 essentially are the standard bell states shown in eq . ( [ bell ] ) . that is the @xmath23 become @xmath24 and @xmath21 become @xmath25 , respectively . the standard bell states can be well distinguished with the cnot gate and the hadamard gate . from fig . 1 , the qubits a@xmath11 and b@xmath11 pass through the cnot gate in a second time , and @xmath24 and @xmath25 will become @xmath26 finally , after the qubit a@xmath11 passing through the hadamard gate , both qubits are measured in the basis @xmath27 . if the measurement result is @xmath28 , the original state is @xmath8 . if the measurement result is @xmath29 , the original state is @xmath30 . on the other hand , if the measurement result is @xmath31 or @xmath32 , the original state is @xmath33 or @xmath34 , respectively . in this way , the lbsa is completed . in this section , we show that the way of distinguishing the lbsa can be used to analysis the arbitrary c - ghz state of the form @xmath35 from eq . ( [ multi1 ] ) , the logic qubits denote as @xmath36 . the c - ghz state analysis for the states in eq . ( [ multi1 ] ) can be simplified to distinguish the states @xmath37 in c - ghz state analysis , we only need to distinguish the states in the logic qubit level , and do not need to care about the exact information in each logic qubit . before we start this protocol , we first transform the states @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath40 , @xmath44 , respectively . such transformation can be completed by performing @xmath45 hadamard operations on each qubit and measuring these @xmath45 qubits in @xmath13 basis . from the measurement results , if the number of @xmath7 is even , the states @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 have fully transformed to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath40 , @xmath44 , respectively . otherwise , if the number of @xmath7 is odd , the states @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 have fully transformed to @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath40 , @xmath48 , respectively . in this way , we should perform a phase - flip operation to transform the states @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath40 , @xmath48 to @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath40 , @xmath44 , respectively . in fig . 2 , we denote each logic qubit @xmath49 as @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath40 , etc . we first perform the hadamard operation on each physical qubit , and make the states in eq . ( [ multi2 ] ) becomes @xmath52 after passing through the cnot gates , the states in eq . ( [ multi3 ] ) can be written as @xmath53 from eq . ( [ multi4 ] ) , all the first physical qubits a@xmath10 , b@xmath10 @xmath40 , n@xmath10 in each logic qubits disentangle with the second one . by removing these qubits , the states in eq . ( [ multi4 ] ) can be written as the standard @xmath1-particle ghz state of the form @xmath54 the @xmath1 particles are denoted as a@xmath11 , b@xmath11 , @xmath40 , n@xmath11 , as shown in fig . therefore , the discrimination of the c - ghz state equals to the discrimination of the standard @xmath1-particle ghz state . the next step can be described as follows . we first perform the cnot gate between the neighboring qubits ( n-1)@xmath11 and n@xmath11 . in fig . 2 , we denote @xmath55 . the qubit k@xmath11 is the source qubit and the qubit n@xmath11 is the target qubit . after performing the cnot operation , we let the qubit ( n-2)@xmath11 be the source qubit and the qubit k@xmath11 ( ( n-1)@xmath11 ) be the target qubit and perform the cnot operation again . in each round , we let the l@xmath11 ( l@xmath11=1,2,@xmath40 , n-1 ) qubit be the source qubit and the ( l+1)@xmath11 qubit be the target qubit and perform the cnot operation . after performing @xmath56 cnot operations , the states in eq . ( [ multi5 ] ) become latexmath:[\\ ] ] from eq . ( [ swapping ] ) , if the lbsa between b and c is projected to @xmath72 , the logic qubits a and d will collapse to the same state with @xmath73 , with the probability of @xmath74 . on the other hand , if the measurement results of b and c are the other states , we can also obtain the corresponding entangled states , which can be transformed to @xmath75 deterministically . in conclusion , we have presented a protocol for lbsa . we exploit the cnot gate , hadamard gate and single qubit measurement to complete the task . we also showed that arbitrary c - ghz state can also be well distinguished . it is shown that the number of physical qubit in each logic qubit does not affect the analysis of c - ghz state . therefore , the analysis of c - ghz state with arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 equals to the analysis of the c - ghz state with @xmath3 . both the lbsa and c - ghz state can be simplified to the standard bell - state analysis and ghz state analysis , respectively , which can be well distinguished with the help of cnot gate . as the c - ghz state is more robust than the normal ghz states in a noisy environment @xcite , our lbsa shows that it is possible to perform the long - distance quantum communication based on the logic qubits rather than the physical qubits directly . this work is supported by the national natural science foundation of china under grant no . 11104159 and 11347110 , and a project funded by the priority academic program development of jiangsu higher education institutions . t. c. ralph and a. p. lund , in proceedings of the 9th international conference on quantum communication measurement and computing , a. lvovsky , ed .

escude et al . 1996 ; gnedin & ostriker 1996 ; zhang et al . 1997 ) have revealed that the ly@xmath0 absorption systems can be explained in terms of the absorption by intergalactic density fluctuations . also , the radiative transfer effects have been stressed by 3d calculations on the reionization of intergalactic matter ( abel , norman , & madau 1999 ; razoumov & scott 1999 ; gnedin 2000 ; nakamoto , umemura , & susa 2000 ; ciardi et al . 2000 ) . here , to elucidate the reionization history , we simulate qso absorption lines by using the results of 3d radiative transfer calculations and compare them to observations at high redshifts . also , the collapse of pregalactic clouds in a reionized universe is explored in relation to the formation of protogalaxies in uv background radiation . in a simulation box , random gaussian density fluctuations are generated based upon the zeldovich approximation in the context of cdm cosmology . the simulation box is irradiated by the isotropic uv background radiation of a power law - type spectrum , @xmath6 erg @xmath7 s@xmath8 hz@xmath8 sr@xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the lyman limit frequency . the ionization structure is obtained by solving the three - dimensional radiative transfer equation . the details of numerical techniques are presented in nakamoto , umemura , & susa ( 2000 ) ( see also the paper by nakamoto et al . in this volume ) . the resultant ionization degrees in the universe are different from place to place by more than three orders of magnitude . due to such inhomogeneous ionization structure , relatively low ionization regions could produce strong absorption in quasar spectra . to make a direct comparison with the observations , we simulate absorption lines . first , we focus on ly@xmath0 absorption . to match the recent observations by the keck telescope , we adopt the resolution of r=45000 and the variance of 0.04 , and assume the voigt profile of lines . the simulated ly@xmath0 absorption features are shown in upper three panels in figure 1 .    in order to compare the simulated absorption degree with observations , we have assessed the so - called continuum depression , @xmath10 . in figure 1 , the simulated @xmath10 is compared to observations at high redshifts . we see that any model with a constant uv intensity does not match the observed trend that @xmath10 tends to grow quickly at redshifts higher than 4 . this implies that the metagalactic uv intensity must decrease rapidly with @xmath1 at @xmath2 by two orders of magnitude at least . the redshift dependence of uv background is required to be @xmath3 $ ] at @xmath2 . if the uv intensity decreases in this fashion , the reionization epoch is estimated to be @xmath11 . if the intensity keeps a level of @xmath12 at @xmath13 , the reionization epoch is assessed to be @xmath14 . thus , it is concluded that the cosmic reionization must have taken place between @xmath4 and 10 . however , the ly@xmath0 absorption is not appropriate to determine the reionization epoch more accurately , because , as seen in the absorption features in figure 1 , ly@xmath0 is too strongly depleted even if the mean neutral fraction is less than @xmath15 . in other words , @xmath10 is no longer sensitive to @xmath16 around the cosmic reionization epoch . as shown in the previous subsection , ly@xmath0 has too high line opacity to probe the universe at @xmath13 . therefore , three conditions are required for a line in order to investigate the universe at @xmath13 : ( 1 ) it has lower line opacity than ly@xmath0 , ( 2 ) line emission is detectable , and ( 3 ) it has lower extinction against dust because young star - forming galaxies are often dust - enshrouded . the most favorable solution seems to be h@xmath0 absorption lines . the h@xmath0 absorption is likely to be relatively weak around @xmath17 , while it could be sensitive to the ionization degrees at @xmath2 . therefore , h@xmath0 forest can be a more powerful tool to probe the universe at @xmath13 . forest has been never detected so far . the reason comes from the fact that h@xmath0 has much weaker opacity than ly@xmath0 . from observational points of view , the h@xmath0 continuum depression can be detected by low - dispersion spectroscopy or narrow - band photometry . furthermore , h@xmath0 forest is subject to less uv bump effects for agns compared to ly@xmath0 forest . the wavelengths of h@xmath0 forest drop on @xmath18 at @xmath19 . thus , the observations can be done with subaru ircs , iris , sirtf , ngst , or h2/l2 . if one can obtain the absorption features with the resolution greater than 10000 , one can recover the density fluctuations at high redshifts . they allow us to determine the linear amplitude of pregalactic perturbations which is by no means measured in the cbr due to the strong sunyaev - zeldovich effects in galactic scales . if one has the amplitude of linear density fluctuations at galactic scales , one can not only set the initial condition for galaxy formation , but also make more reliable determination of cosmological parameters . here , the cosmology is assumed to have @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 with usual meanings . susa & umemura ( 2000a ) have explored the sheet collapse of a pregalactic cloud under uv background radiation , with including h@xmath24 chemistry . they have found that the cloud evolution is specified by two initial parameters , i.e. , the mean density ( @xmath25 ) and the thickness ( @xmath26 ) . the initial parameter dependence is translated into the baryonic mass [ @xmath27 and the collapse epoch ( @xmath28 ) by assuming the initial stage is close to the maximum expansion of a density fluctuation . the numerical results have shown that the cloud evolution bifurcates into two characteristic states , i.e. , ( a ) a pregalactic cloud is self - shielded against the external uv in the course of the sheet collapse , so that the cloud cools down below @xmath29k due to h@xmath24 cooling and undergoes efficient star formation . hence , it is expected to evolve into an early type galaxy with a high bulge - to - disk ratio ( b / d ) due to the dissipationless virialization , or ( b ) a cloud is not self - shielded during the sheet collapse , but is self - shielded through the shrink to the rotation barrier . this leads to the retarded star formation , and thus the virialization would proceed in a fairly dissipative fashion . as a result , a late type ( small b / d ) galaxy would be preferentially born . such bifurcation is specified solely by a mass scale as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the collapse epoch and @xmath32 is the uv background intensity in units of @xmath33 .      here we include the effect of the evolution of uv background radiation . we assume @xmath34 ^ 3 $ ] for @xmath35 and @xmath36 for @xmath37 . this dependence is consistent with the uv intensity in the present epoch ( maloney 1993 ; dove & shull 1994 ) , and the value inferred from the qso proximity effects at intermediate redshifts ( bajtlik , duncan , & ostriker 1988 ; giallongo et al . 1996 ) . as for @xmath38 , two models are employed . the first one is ( a ) the exponentially damping model , @xmath39 $ ] , which is inferred by the continuum depression , and the second one is ( b ) the constant extrapolation model , @xmath40 . then , based upon the above paradigm of the galaxy formation under uv background , the evolutionary bifurcation of pregalactic clouds is confronted with observations of elliptical and spiral galaxies . using the observed properties of galaxies , the collapse epochs are assessed for each type of galaxies with attentive mass estimation ( susa & umemura 2000b ) . the comparison of observed galaxies with the bifurcation theory is presented in figure 2 . small open circles represent spiral galaxies in persic & salucci ( 1995 ) . small filled triangles denote the e and e - s0 galaxies in faber et al . open stars are elliptical galaxies from x - ray observations in matsumoto et al . the thick solid and dashed lines represent the bifurcation mass @xmath41 , respectively for model a and b , where both are identical at @xmath42 . by this direct comparison of the theory with the observations , it turns out that the theoretical bifurcation branch successfully discriminates between elliptical and spiral galaxies . this suggests that the uv background radiation could play a profound role for the differentiation of the galactic morphology into the hubble sequence . in figure 2 , the density fluctuations in the cdm cosmology are also plotted by three thin solid lines marked as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the variance of cdm perturbations . we find that the bifurcation mass scale coincides with the @xmath47 density fluctuations . thus , the present results are also intriguing from a view point of the density morphology relation of galaxies , because higher @xmath46 peaks reside preferentially in denser regions rather than in low - dense regions . using the ionization structure in an inhomogeneous universe obtained by 3d radiative transfer calculations on the reionization , we have simulated qso absorption lines at high redshifts . by comparison of simulated ly@xmath0 continuum depression with recent observations , it has been found that the metagalactic uv intensity must decrease rapidly with @xmath1 at @xmath2 , and the reionization must have taken place between @xmath4 and 10 . based on this time - dependence of uv background intensity , we have explored the collapse of pregalactic clouds in the uv background , and found that the degree of self - shielding bifurcates the evolution of protogalaxies . the bifurcation is characterized by a mass scale dependent on uv background intensity and redshift . by confrontation with observations it has turned out that the bifurcation mass successfully discriminates between elliptical and spiral galaxies . this suggests that the uv background radiation is closely related to the final bulge - to - disk ratios of galaxies . we have assumed here agn - like ionizing sources , but which type of sources reionized the universe is still an issue under a lot of debate . anyhow , the present analysis suggests that to elucidate precisely the reionization history is extraordinarily important for the understanding of galaxy formation . abel , t. , norman , m. l. , & madau , p. 1999 , apj , 523 , 66 bajtlik , s. duncan , r. c. , & ostriker , j. p. 1988 , apj , 327 , 570 ciardi , b. , ferrara , a. , marri , s. , & raimondo , g. 2000 ( astro -

{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an abstract creator who takes in papers and generates good scientific abstracts"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Make an abstract for the following paper: \nsilicene is a two dimensional buckled material which is closely related to graphene . it has been proposed as a potential candidate for overcoming the limitations of graphene because of stronger intrinsic spin orbit coupling ( 4 mev in silicene and @xmath1 mev in graphene @xcite ) . silicene first has been reported to be stable by takeda and shiraishi @xcite . though c and si belong to the same group of the periodic table , si has a larger ionic radius , which promotes @xmath2 hybridization . theoretical studies predict that free standing silicene has a stable two - dimensional buckled honeycomb structure @xcite , where the buckling is due to the mixture of @xmath3 and @xmath2 hybridizations . the magnitude of the buckling is @xmath4 0.45  , which opens an electrically tunable band gap @xcite , whereas the induced band gap due to the intrinsic spin orbit coupling amounts to 1.55 mev @xcite . the charge carriers behave like massless dirac fermions in the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands , which form dirac cones at the fermi level at the k and k@xmath7 points . the electronic properties of silicene and its derivatives have been studied in much detail by density functional theory calculations @xcite . in particular , it has been reported that the lattice is sensitive to the carrier concentration but still stable in a wide range of doping @xcite .    experimentally , growth of silicene and its derivatives has been reported for metallic substrates like ag and zrb@xmath8 @xcite . silicene on a zrb@xmath8 thin film shows an asymmetric buckling due to strong interaction with the substrate , which increases the band gap . as in general accurate measurements of materials properties are problematic on substrates , it is desirable to achieve free standing silicene . however , this first requires the growth on appropriate substrates that make it possible to separate the silicene sheet . for the growth of silicene on any kind of substrate , the effect of strain is crucial to be understood . in this work , we focus on this topic using first - principles calculations . we apply strain up to 20% and calculate the corresponding band structure to evaluate the dependence of the induced doping on the strength of the biaxial tensile strain . furthermore , we study the phonon spectrum to address the stability of the system and calculate the grneisen parameter . we have carried out calculations using density functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation @xcite . the van der waals interaction @xcite is taken into account in order to correctly describe the geometry . the calculations are performed with a plane wave cutoff energy of 816 ev . moreover , a monkhorst - pack @xmath9 k - mesh is employed for optimizing the crystal structure and calculating the phonon spectrum , whereas a @xmath10 k - mesh is used for the density of states ( dos ) in order to achieve higher resolution . the atomic positions are relaxed until an energy convergence of 10@xmath11 ev and a force convergence of @xmath12 ev /   are reached . we use an interlayer spacing of 16   to avoid artifacts of the periodic boundary conditions . the magnitude of the biaxial tensile strain is defined as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15   are the lattice parameters of the strained and unstrained silicene , respectively . for graphene it has been demonstrated that 5 to 10% strain can be achieved without much efforts @xcite . the existing reports confirm this makes the system five times more reactive and h atoms are bound much stronger than in pristine graphene @xcite . since a similar enhancement of h storage by strain can be expected for silicene , we study in the following the effect of strain on the electronic and mechanical properties . a top view of the crystal structure under consideration is shown in fig .  1 . for unstrained silicene we obtain a lattice parameter of @xmath16   and a buckling of 0.45  , consistent with previously reported data @xcite . in a first step , we address the dependence of the force on the applied strain , see the results in fig .  2 . the force increases monotonically with the strain up to a strain of 17% and decreases thereafter , which indicates that silicene is stable up to 17% strain . the stability limit will be addressed in more detail via the phonon spectrum in the following section . the band gap of 2 mev in unstrained silicene becomes smaller for increasing strain . since strain weakens the internal electric field ( by reducing the magnitude of the buckling ) the spin orbit coupling and thus the induced band gap are reduced . the si@xmath0si bond length is found to grow with the strain monotonically , which explains why the buckling decreases . surprisingly , the buckling starts to increase again when the strain exceeds 10% . for example , unstrained silicene has a si@xmath0si bond length of 2.28   and buckling of 0.46  . for 5% strain these values change to 2.37   and 0.32  , and for 17% strain to 2.47   and 0.30  . the variation of the si@xmath0si bond length and buckling under strain are addressed in fig . 3(a ) and ( b ) , respectively . the variation of the doping level ( defined as the shift of the dirac cone with respect to the fermi level ) under strain is addressed in fig . it is well known that unstrained silicene is a semimetal , where the @xmath17 and @xmath18 orbitals give rise to @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands forming dirac cones at the k and k@xmath7 points , see fig . the calculated band structure shows that the dirac cone lies at the fermi level upto a strain of 5% with a 2 mev band gap due to intrinsic spin orbit coupling . for higher strain the conduction band at the @xmath19-point shifts towards the fermi level , consistent with ref . @xcite . at a strain of 7% it slightly crosses the fermi level , which shifts the dirac cone above the fermi level by @xmath4 0.06 ev , inducing hole doping , see fig . the doping is enhanced for increasing strain , since the conduction band minimum at the @xmath19-point shifts further downwards and becomes more and more occupied ( with an increasing dos at the fermi level ) . the main reason for hole doping in silicene under strain is this downshift and the consequent occupation of the band at the @xmath19-point . it is a consequence of the weakening of the bonds due to the increasing si@xmath0si bond length . another ingredient is a reduction of the hybridization between the @xmath20 and @xmath21 orbitals , which in fact are occupied by 1.18 and 2.76 electrons in unstrained silicene , respectively , but by 1.33 and 2.63 electrons for 10% strain .        at 10% strain the dirac point lies at 0.18 ev , see fig . we note that the @xmath5 and @xmath6 bands are due to the @xmath17 orbitals with minute contributions from the @xmath22 and @xmath23 orbitals , as expected , see the projected doss . for higher strain the conduction band minimum shifts further to lower energy and the dirac cone accordingly to higher energy . it reaches 1.0 ev with the dirac point at 0.34 ev for a strain of 20% . this behavior is different from graphene despite the quantitatively similar band structure , because the si@xmath0si bonds are more flexible than the c@xmath0c bonds . in contrast to silicene , graphene does not show significant changes in the electronic structure in the presence of strain , resulting a zero band gap semiconductor up to a huge strain of 30% @xcite . as a result , doping can not be achieved in graphene by strain . we now discuss the phonon spectrum of silicene without strain and under strain of 5% , 10% , 15% , 20% , and 25% . without strain the optical phonon frequencies are found to be @xmath4 33% smaller than in graphene @xcite , which is understood by the smaller force constant and weaker si@xmath0si bonds . in fact , the si@xmath0si bond length of 2.28   is 37% larger than the c@xmath0c bond length . in fig . 5 we address the phonon band structure , where we focus on the highest branches at the @xmath19-point ( g mode ) and the k - point ( d mode ) . the calculated phonon frequencies at the @xmath19 and k - points are 550 @xmath24 and 545 @xmath24 , respectively , which agree well with previous theoretical results @xcite . a significant modification of the phonon frequencies is observed for strained silicene . for a strain of 5% the g and d mode frequencies amount to 460 @xmath24 and 386 @xmath24 , respectively , reflecting the weakening of the si@xmath0si bond under strain . increase of the strain to 10% ( 17% ) results in phonon frequencies of 372 @xmath24 ( 296 @xmath24 ) for the g mode and 272 @xmath24 ( 187 @xmath24 ) for the d mode . we still have positive frequencies along the @xmath19-k direction and , hence , a stable lattice . an instability comes into the picture when the strain increases beyond 17% . at 20% strain we find a frequency of @xmath25 @xmath24 and at 25% strain , see fig . 5(c ) , the lattice is strongly instable . importantly , no splitting of the g mode for increasing strain is observed in our calculations in contrast to graphene @xcite . the grneisen parameter is an important quantity to describe strained materials as it measures the rate of phonon mode softening or hardening and , thus , determines the thermomechanical properties . the grneisen parameter for the g mode is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the difference in the frequency with and without strain and @xmath28 is the frequency of the g mode in unstrained silicene . a significant variation of the grneisen parameter between 1.64 and 1.42 for strain between 5 and 25 % is found , see table i. these values are close to the experimental and theoretically values for graphene @xcite . while the experimentally reported grneisen parameters for graphene are not consistent due to substrate effects , there are no experimental data available for silicene for comparison . we find that the grneisen parameter first decreases with growing strain due to the reduced buckling of the two si sublattices but increases again for higher strain as also the buckling increases . this behavior is fundamentally different from graphene , which is not subject to buckling . an experimental confirmation of our observations by raman spectroscopy would be desirable .    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ] in conclusion , we have used density functional theory to study the effect of biaxial tensile strain on the structure , electronic properties , and phonon modes of silicene . our calculations demonstrate that up to 5% strain the dirac cone remains essentially at the fermi level but starts to shift to higher energy for higher strain . therefore , strain can be used in silicene , in contrast to graphene , to induce hole doping . the different behavior of the two compounds , despite their close stuctural similarity , can be explained in terms of bonding and changes in the hybridizations . strain results in a weakening of the si@xmath0si bonds . as a consequence , an electronic band at the @xmath19-point of the brillouin zone shifts to lower energy and becomes partially occupied , which in turn leads to a depopulation of the dirac cone . the buckling is found to decrease with increasing strain up to 10% but starts to increase again thereafter . accordingly , the calculated grneisen parameter behaves differently than in graphene as the latter is not subject to buckling . positive phonon frequencies up to a strain of 17% indicate lattices stability in this regime , whereas the lattice becomes instable at higher strain . p. giannozzi , s. baroni , n. bonini , m. calandra , r. car , c. cavazzoni , d. ceresoli , g. l. chiarotti , m. cococcioni , i. dabo , a. dal corso , s. de gironcoli , s. fabris , g. fratesi , r. gebauer , u. gerstmann , c. gougoussis , a. kokalj , m. lazzeri , l. martin - samos , n. marzari , f. mauri , r. mazzarello , s. paolini , a. pasquarello , l. paulatto , c. sbraccia , s. scandolo , g. sclauzero , a. p. seitsonen , a. smogunov , p. umari , and r. m. wentzcovitch , j. phys . * 21 * , 395502 ( 2009 ) . t. m. g. mohiuddin , a. lombardo , r. r. nair , a. bonetti , g. savini , r. jalil , n. bonini , d. m. basko , c. galiotis , n. marzari , k. s. novoselov , a. k. geim , and a. c. ferrari , phys . b * 79 * , 205433 ( 2009 ) .

'' to address this concern the 1994 flight of the medium scale anisotropy measurement ( msam1 ) observed the same field as the 1992 flight to limit the possibility of systematic sources of the signal . @xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) reported observations of anisotropy in the cmbr from the first flight of msam1 in 1992 ( msam1 - 92 ) . @xcite ( hereafter paper  ii ) reported the results from the second flight in 1994 ( msam1 - 94 ) . a conclusion of the latter is that while a quantitative comparison was pending , there was good qualitative agreement between the two flights in the double difference data set , and that agreement was inconclusive for the single difference data set . this letter presents a quantitative comparison of the msam1 - 92 and msam1 - 94 data sets . the msam1 instrument has been fully described in @xcite ( hereafter paper  iii ) ; only an overview is given here . it is an off - axis cassegrain telescope with a 4-channel bolometric radiometer at the focus . the beamsize is 28  fwhm and is moved @xmath3 on the sky by the nutating secondary . the radiometer has 4 frequency channels placed at 5.7 , 9.3 , 16.5 , and 22.6 . for these observation , emission in the lower two channels is dominated by the cmbr , while @xmath4 interstellar dust dominates the two higher channels . the instrument configuration was similar for the two flights , with changes made only to the warm signal electronics and the gondola structure . these changes are discussed extensively in paper  iii ; the modifications to the electronics improved the noise performance , while those to the gondola reduced sidelobe sensitivity . the original superstructure had a large reflecting area above the beam , from which earthshine could potentially diffract into the beam . for the second flight , the gondola was suspended by a cable system which reduced the far - sidelobe response . the measured near sidelobe response dropped from in 1992 in the worst case to less than in all cases in 1994 . as described in papers  i and ii , the observed field is two strips at declination @xmath5 , from right ascension 1527 to 1684 , and from 1757 to 1971 ( all coordinates are j1994.5 ) . [ f_fields ] shows the weighted beam centers of the fields observed in the 1992 and 1994 flights . a ccd camera is used to determine absolute pointing for both flights . the final accuracy of the pointing determination is 25 , limited by the gyroscope signal interpolation . this 25 uncertainty is small compared to the size of our beam ( 28 ) and the bins ( 14 ) used below , ensuring adequate alignment of the two datasets .    during both flights jupiter was observed to calibrate the instrument and map the telescope beam . beam maps and calibrations are done separately for the two flights . the shape of the beam map is determined to 4% of the maximum amplitude . random noise in the gyroscope system contributes 3.5% , and cosmic rays striking the detectors contribute 1.5% . also , the choice of smoothing algorithm causes a 1.5% systematic effect . combining this 4% error from each flight gives a 5.8% relative calibration uncertainty . the uncertainty in jupiter s intrinsic brightness leads to an additional systematic uncertainty of 10% for the results of each flight ; however , except for possible time variations in jupiter s brightness which we do not expect , this uncertainty does not contribute to the comparison of the two flights discussed here the analyzed data sets reported in papers  i and ii can not be directly compared for two reasons : 1 ) the boundaries of the sky bins are different , and 2 ) the analysis reported in paper  i neglects correlations introduced by the removal of the small offset drift . the 1992 data is reanalyzed to account for these correlations , using a procedure nearly identical to that of paper  ii . the 1994 data is also reanalyzed , with differences from the original analysis noted in the text below . here we first review the paper  ii analysis , then note the differences between that and the reanalysis used here . first , the cosmic ray events are removed from the time stream . cosmic ray removal techniques are different for the two years , and are discussed in papers  i and ii . the data are then analyzed in a manner that provides sensitivity to two different angular scales on the sky . this is done by weighting the the time stream , @xmath6 , with one of two demodulation templates , @xmath7 , giving one `` demodulated data point '' , @xmath8 , for each full cycle of the secondary mirror movement . the `` single difference demodulation '' weights the secondary - left data positively while weighting the secondary - right data negatively , giving a @xmath9 equal to the difference between the left and right temperatures . the result is a two lobed beam pattern on the sky with 80  beam separation . the `` double difference demodulation '' weights the secondary - centered data positively , while weighting the secondary - left and secondary - right data negatively , giving a @xmath9 equal to the difference between the center and the side temperatures . this produces a three lobed beam pattern on the sky , with 40  beam separation . the single difference and double difference data are nearly statistically independent . a linear model is fit to these demodulated data including intensity for each sky bin and slow drifts in time . the noise used in the fit is estimated from the data . both the time drift and noise estimate are described further below . the results of the linear fit are signal amplitudes for each sky bin with their associated covariances . a spectral model for each sky bin consisting of cmbr anisotropy plus emission from galactic dust , with emissivity proportional to frequency to the 1.5 power , is fit to all four frequency channels of binned sky data . the results of this spectral fit are the intensity of a `` dust '' component and a `` cmbr '' component in each sky bin . the differences between the paper  ii analysis and that done for this paper follow . this analysis uses a 024 bin size , double the size used in paper  ii , which corresponds to the size of the central beam plateau . angular orientation bins , which account for sky rotation relative to the secondary chop axis , are 20 , also double the previous size . the weighted beam centers of the identical bins are shown as filled symbols in fig . [ f_fields ] . the noise estimates are formed from demodulated data . this is a change from paper  ii , where the estimate is made after after having removed the drift model . the noise estimates are made separately for each minute of data by measuring the rms of the demodulated data in that minute . the new noise estimate is used in reanalyzing both the 1992 and 1994 datasets . true sky signals make a negligible contribution to this rms estimate over these short time scales . this change has no substantial effect on the results of this letter . also , in paper  ii the drift model included terms based on gondola sensors ( air pressure , and the pitch and roll angles of the gondola outer frame ) . this model was used in the 1994 reanalysis , while it was not used for the 1992 reanalysis . instead , the original model for the drifts described in paper  i , a spline with knots every 2.5 minutes , was used . we compare the signal measured at each point on the sky as measured in the two flights , not just the rms levels of the sky signal found in each data set . in the 1994 flight , we attempted to observe the identical swath of sky observed in the 1992 flight . as can be seen in fig . [ f_fields ] , which is extremely enlarged in declination relative to right ascension , the 1994 flight was low by about 10  . to enable direct comparison , only the data from those bins which fall into the center declination bin is used . after this selection @xmath450% of the data is retained . the data from the 1992 flight is differenced from that of the 1994 flight to form a difference data set ,  . similarly , the two data sets are summed to form a sum data set ,  . this is done for each demodulation and for both cmbr and dust . to allow for differing offsets in the two flights , a weighted mean is removed from each dataset . the covariance matrix , @xmath10 , for both the sum and difference sets is the sum of the masked 1992 and 1994 covariance matrices . there is no cross term because the flights have independent noise . the significance of any detected signal in the sum or difference is tested with a @xmath11 statistic , @xmath12    the @xmath11 and degrees of freedom , and the cumulative probability , @xmath13 , for the comparison is shown in table  [ t_chi ] . @xmath14 is the probability of getting a value of @xmath11 at or above the observed value , under the assumption that there is no signal in the data . this should be the case for the difference data , where the common sky signal should cancel .    to check the effect of the relative calibration uncertainty on @xmath11 , the 1994 dataset is rescaled by @xmath15 and the value of @xmath11 recalculated . in all cases @xmath16 . a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ( @xcite ) of the probabilities ( .04 , .22 , .41 , and .91 ) gives a 74% probability that these are drawn from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1 . based on this , we conclude that the  data in both the single and double difference demodulations for both the cmbr and dust components is consistent with no observed signal .    a ks test of the  probabilities ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 ) gives a @xmath21 probability that these are drawn from a uniform distribution from 0 to 1 . from this , together with the extremely low @xmath11 probabilities themselves , we see that there are statistically significant signals in all four  datasets . this result , combined with the absence of such signals in the  datasets , enables us to conclude that the signals observed during the two flights are common , and therefore present on the sky . rlcc    cmbr & & 52 / 45 & 0.22 & & 89 / 45 & @xmath20 dust & & 47 / 45 & 0.41 & & 145 / 45 & @xmath17 cmbr & & 33 / 45 & 0.91 & & 118 / 45 & @xmath22 dust & & 63 / 45 & 0.04 & & 109 / 45 & @xmath19 the same region of the sky was observed in the 1992 and 1994 flights to confirm the detection of a celestial signal . it is clear from the statistical analysis that the same sky signal is measured in these two flights . we conclude that at the level of our signal , our measurements are likely to be free from significant contamination from time - varying systematics such as sidelobe pickup or atmospheric contamination . in addition to our own confirmation of the msam1 - 92 results , the saskatoon experiment has recently observed this section of sky at lower frequencies , 36  ghz to 46  ghz ( @xcite ) . they have compared their signal with the double difference cmbr signal from paper i , and find good agreement . this result , spanning nearly a decade in frequency , is strong evidence that we are observing cmbr anisotropies rather than some other astrophysical foreground source . we would like to thank e. magnier , r. rutledge , l. knox , and a. goldin for useful conversations . the research was supported by the nasa office of space science , astrophysics division through grants ntg 50720 and 50908 and rtop 188 - 44 . wilkinson , d. 1995 . a warning label for cosmic microwave background anisotropy experiments . in astbury , a. _ et  al . _ , editors , _ particle physics and cosmology , proceedings of the ninth lake louise winter institute _ , page 110 , singapore . world scientific .

[ fig : d2 ] ) , with an amplitude of 5% or less for currently popular cosmological models @xcite . the higher modes are roughly out of phase with the photon peaks ( also in @xmath4-space ) and appear half as often as the peaks in the cmb spectrum ( see e.g.  fig .  1 of @xcite ) . the peaks are suppressed by silk damping beyond @xmath5mpc . naively the best way to measure the small baryonic oscillations in the matter power spectrum would be an ultra - large galaxy redshift survey at high-@xmath0 . such a survey would require next - generation instruments and a large dedicated team . thus even with adequate funding and heroic efforts it is several years away . it is therefore interesting to explore whether one could measure the baryonic oscillations another way .    within a few years the sdss will return a catalogue of @xmath6 qsos over @xmath7 square degrees of sky . these quasars will be distributed in both redshift and angular separation , but simple counting suggests that one should find many hundreds to several thousands with separations of tens of mpc above @xmath8 . it is therefore interesting to ask whether this sample could be used to probe the baryon oscillations . using simply the auto - power spectrum of the forest will not work , because the line - of - sight spectrum at @xmath4 is an integral of the 3d spectrum over wavenumbers greater than @xmath4 . this integration suppresses the small oscillations which are our primary signal . however one can consider the cross - spectra , where one line - of - sight is cross - correlated with a neighboring line - of - sight . as we shall show below this statistic is sensitive to the oscillations . in addition uncorrelated errors from e.g.  continuum fitting , should be averaged down in this procedure relative to their value in the auto - spectrum . since we are working on large scales , where the noise is essentially absent , one could in principle measure the flux cross - spectrum to the cosmic variance limit @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the number of pairs , @xmath11 is the fundamental mode along the line - of - sight and @xmath12 is the width of the bin in @xmath4-space in which we are measuring the power . we can alternatively write @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the length of the ` useful ' part of the spectrum . unless we attempt to fit to the higher lines , the useful length of the spectrum is the section between and ly@xmath15 which covers hundreds of mpc in the rest frame of the absorbers . thus with a few hundred pairs it is possible to measure the cross - spectrum with error bars on the order of per cent . one major advantage here is that , like the cmb itself , the redshift and scale dependence of the peaks is accurately calculable given a cosmological model . this allows us to perform a likelihood estimation of the relevant cosmological factors , including pairs of different distances and redshifts , rather than attempt to perform an inversion on the irregularly sampled data . though the latter can be done , it is considerably more difficult than the ` forward ' approach .    by applying the idea of the peak - background split from large - scale structure is it possible to show that , for sufficiently large scales and assuming @xmath16 , the flux cross - spectrum , @xmath17 , along two lines of sight separated by distance @xmath18 is proportional to the dark matter cross - power spectrum @xmath19 ( see also @xcite ) . on these very large scales we can neglect the effects of thermal broadening or peculiar velocities . the dm cross - spectrum is simply related to the 3d power spectrum by @xmath20 or @xcite @xmath21 where the inverse relation holds @xmath22 . note that for smooth spectra , @xmath23 gets contributions from @xmath24 . as @xmath25 , @xmath26 and we find the auto - spectrum is the projection of the 3d spectrum as anticipated . converting from @xmath27mpc to s / km using @xmath28 we find that the relevant spectral range is roughly @xmath29s / km to @xmath30s / km . this is quite large scale , roughly comparable to the fundamental mode if we measure only from 100 nm to 120 nm .    on the positive side fig . [ fig : pi ] shows that the signal is present in the cross spectra at separations of 10mpc or so . the relative amplitude of the oscillations ( which is the figure of merit for cosmic variance dominated measurements ) can be quite large , 10% or more , compared to the accuracy with which @xmath19 can be measured . because we can accurately predict the positions and amplitudes of the peaks we know both the @xmath18 and @xmath0 dependence of the signal .    on the negative side there is only a small fractional change in @xmath19 when @xmath19 is big ( i.e.  @xmath18 small ) and the larger fractional change in @xmath19 when @xmath19 is small . this suggests we would be working primarily at very low signal levels , where systematics become increasingly important . also , if we work with the spectra only between and ly@xmath15 we do not have very much ` spare ' resolution in @xmath4 to see the oscillations . we would ideally probe @xmath31s / km which requires very long spectra .    in summary , the signal of baryon oscillations is lurking in the cross - spectra of qso pairs , which allow us to probe large volumes of space at high redshift with a modest investment in telescope time . a naive estimate of the cosmic variance limitations of a qso survey like the sdss suggests that the signal could be seen in a likelihood analysis with high confidence . however the overall signal levels are very low and there are numerous sources of systematic error which may make the signal forever unmeasurable . currently the sources that make up the uv background are unknown . however the mean optical depth @xmath32 in the forest offers a way to constrain the source emissivity and fluctuations in the uvbg can be used to constrain the nature of the sources . i have been involved in a long - running collaboration with avery meiksin to investigate these issues @xcite , and present some of our basic results here . first we consider the constraints on the source emissivity @xmath33 . given a cosmological model , the mean flux or optical depth @xmath32 fixes the ionization rate @xmath34 . if we approximate @xmath35 $ ] as @xmath36 $ ] where @xmath37 is the _ attenuation length _ then @xmath38 . here @xmath39 is an effective attenuation length which interpolates between the attenuation limited ( @xmath40 ) and cosmological expansion+age limited ( @xmath41 ) regimes and @xmath42 is the hubble distance .    as a function of @xmath33 the transition between the attenuation limited and cosmologically limited regimes is very abrupt , and at fixed @xmath33 , @xmath37 falls rapidly with increasing redshift . this in turn means that @xmath32 rises rapidly , almost exponentially , with redshift . [ fig : fig3 ] shows the emissivity of the sources , as a function of @xmath0 , required to fit the observed @xmath32 . this is compared to extrapolations of the qso luminosity function . from this we can see that qsos may contribute a substantial fraction of the uv background even as high as @xmath43 . if qsos do contribute non - negligibly to the uv background then we would expect large spatial fluctuations in @xmath34 . conversely , if galaxies or star clusters dominate the uv background we expect to see only the imprint of large - scale structure . unfortunately the effects of uv background correlations are most conspicuous at @xmath44 , where the precise level of absorption by the forest is most difficult to measure because of extremely low flux values .    fig . [ fig : onesource ] shows how a simulated spectrum is changed if the uv background is ( unrealistically ) dominated by a single source as compared to the usually assumed smooth behavior . to assess a more realistic situation it is necessary to resort to monte carlo simulations in which sources are placed within the simulation volume , the uv background computed and then spectra created from the density and velocity fields within the box . our investigations suggest that the 1-point distribution is relatively unaffected by fluctuations in the uvbg , however the 2-point statistics ( the flux correlation function and power spectrum ) show noticeable differences at high redshift @xcite . in addition fluctuations in the uvbg will increase the estimated optical depth over the value that would be estimated assuming a homogeneous background @xcite . this increases the demand placed on the ionization rate required to reproduce @xmath32 and needs to be included when comparing with estimates of source emissivity . the forest is emerging as a powerful probe of structure formation at high redshift . because the physics is relatively well understood we can compare increasingly realistic calculations with ever better data to constrain our cosmological models . here we have investigated two ways in which the forest constrains cosmology . the first , speculative , proposal was to search for baryonic oscillations in the matter power spectrum through their imprint in the forest cross - spectra . the second proposal was to constrain the emissivity of the sources of the uv background using the measured mean optical depth of qso spectra . in the first case we found that while in principle the signal - to - noise and statistics of the signal were favorable , in practice the very low signal levels made this measurement prone to numerous systematic effects . in the second case we showed that reasonable extrapolations of the qso luminosity function to high-@xmath0 would allow qsos to contribute a non - negligible fraction of the uv background even as early as @xmath45 . if this turns out to be the case , the uv background should have relatively large spatial fluctuations which can affect the 2-point statistics of the forest at high @xmath0 . _ acknowledgements : _ i thank simon white for allowing me to present our work on baryon oscillations in the forest , and avery meiksin for several years of productive collaborations , including many enlightening conversations on the physics of the igm . i would also like to thank the organizers for such an interesting and successful conference .

write equation 1 as @xmath4 where the coefficient 1.9 ( instead of the usual 1.2 - 1.3 ) represents the fragment deformation . for symmetric fission , z@xmath5=z@xmath6=z/2 and a@xmath5 = a@xmath6=a/2 , then we have @xmath7 trajectory calculations @xcite for alpha particle emission in fission have shown that the fission fragments are in motion at scission with a pre - scission kinetic energy of 7.3 mev and an additive term representing this motion is needed . thus we have the  viola systematics \" @xcite that say @xmath8    the deformed scission point fragments will contract to their equilibrium deformations and the energy stored in deformation will be converted into internal excitation energy . thus we can define a related quantity , the total excitation energy , txe , in fission as @xmath9where q is the mass - energy release . one quickly realizes that these quantities depend on the mass split in fission which in turn , at low excitation energies , may reflect the fragment nuclear structure . the txe is the starting point for calculations of the prompt neutron and gamma emission in fission , the yields of beta emitting fission fragments , reactor anti - neutrino spectra , etc . as such , it is a fundamental property of all fissioning systems and sadly not very well known .    as a practical matter , one needs to know the dependence of the tke and txe on neutron energy for the neutron induced fission of technologically important actinide fissioning systems like @xmath10u(n , f),@xmath0u(n , f ) , and @xmath11pu(n , f ) . the first question we might pose is whether the tke should depend on the excitation energy of the fissioning system . does the energy brought in by an incident neutron in neutron induced fission appear in the fragment excitation energy or does it appear in the total kinetic energy ? in a variety of experiments , one finds that increasing the excitation energy of the fissioning system does not lead to significant increases in the tke of the fission fragments or changes in the fragment separation at scission . however , there may be more subtle effects that render this statement false in some circumstances . for example , we expect , on the basis of the coulomb energy systematics given above , that the tke will be proportional to changes in the fission mass splits which in turn can depend on the excitation energy .    for the technologically important reaction @xmath0u(n , f ) , madland @xcite summarizes the known data @xcitewith the following equations @xmath12 @xmath13 where e@xmath1 is the energy of the incident neutron and t@xmath14and t@xmath15 are the average total fission fragment kinetic energy ( before neutron emission ) and the average fission product kinetic energy after neutron emission , respectively . these quantities are related by the relation @xmath16\\ ] ] these data show a modest decrease in tke with increasing excitation energy for the neutron energy interval e@xmath1 = 1 - 9 mev . there is no clearly identified changes in the tke values near the second chance fission threshold , a feature that is important in semi - empirical models of fission such as represented by the gef code.@xcite    in this paper , we report the results of measuring the total kinetic energy release in the neutron induced fission of @xmath0u for neutron energies e@xmath1 = 3.2 -50 mev . the method used for the measurement is the 2e method , i.e. , measurement of the kinetic energies of the two coincident fission products using semiconductor detectors . the time of flight of the neutrons inducing fission was measured , allowing deduction of their energy . the details of the experiment are discussed in section ii while the experimental results and a comparison of the results with various models and theories is made in section iii with conclusions being summarized in section iv . this experiment was carried out at the weapons neutron research facility ( wnr ) at the los alamos neutron science center ( lansce ) at the los alamos national laboratory @xcite .  white spectrum \" neutron beams were generated from an unmoderated tungsten spallation source using the 800 mev proton beam from the lansce linac . the experiment was located on the 15r beam line ( 15@xmath17-right with respect to the proton beam ) . the calculated ( mcnpx )  white spectrum \" at the target position is shown in figure 1 . @xcite the proton beam is pulsed allowing one to measure the time of flight ( energy ) of the neutrons arriving at the experimental area .    a schematic diagram of the experimental apparatus is shown in figure 2 . the neutron beam was collimated to a 1 cm diameter at the entrance to the experimental area . at the entrance to the scattering chamber , the beam diameter was measured to be 1.3 cm . a fission ionization chamber @xcite was used to continuously monitor the absolute neutron beam intensities . the @xmath0u target and the si pin diode fission detectors were housed in an evacuated , thin - walled aluminum scattering chamber . the scattering chamber was located @xmath18 3.1 m from the collimator , and @xmath18 11 m from the neutron beam dump . the center of the scattering chamber was located 16.46 m from the production target . the @xmath0u target consisted of a deposit of @xmath0uf@xmath19 on a thin c backing . the thickness of the @xmath0u was 175.5 @xmath20 g @xmath0u/@xmath21 while the backing thickness was 100 @xmath20g/@xmath21 . the isotopic purity of the @xmath0u was 99.91 @xmath22 . the target was tilted at 50 @xmath17 with respect to the incident beam . fission fragments were detected by two arrays of si pin photodiodes ( hamamatsu s3590 - 09 ) arranged on opposite sides of the beam . the area of the individual pin diodes was 1 @xmath21 . the distance of the detectors from the target varied with angle from 2.60 cm to 4.12 cm . the coincident detector pairs were at approximately 45 , 60 , 90 , 115 , and 135 @xmath17 . the alpha particle energy resolution of the diodes was 18 kev for the 5475 kev line of @xmath23am . the time of flight of each interacting neutron was measured using a timing pulse from a si pin diode and the accelerator rf signal . absolute calibrations of this time scale were obtained from the photofission peak in the fission spectra and the known flight path geometry . the energy calibration of the fission detectors was done with a @xmath24cf source . we have used the traditional schmitt method @xcite . some have criticized this method especially for pin diodes . however with our limited selection of detectors , we were unable to apply the methods of @xcite to achieve a robust substitute for the schmitt method . the measured fragment energies have be to be corrected for energy loss in the @xmath0uf@xmath25 deposit and the c backing foil . this correction was done by scaling the energy loss correction given by the northcliffe - schilling energy loss tables @xcite to a measured mean energy loss of collimated beams of light and heavy @xmath24cf fission fragments in 100 @xmath20 g/@xmath21 c foils . the scaling factor that was used was a linear function of mass using the average loss of the heavy and light fission fragments as anchor points . the correction factors at the anchor points were 1.24 and 1.45 for the heavy and light fragments , respectively . similar factors were obtained if the srim code @xcite was used to calculate de / dx . these large deviation factors from measured to calculated fission fragment stopping powers have been observed in the past @xcite , and represent the largest systematical uncertainty in the determination of the kinetic energies . the measured average post - neutron emission fission product total kinetic energy release for the @xmath0u(n , f ) reaction(table 1 ) is shown in figure 3 along with other data and predictions @xcite . the evaluated post - neutron emission data from madlund @xcite are shown as a dashed line while the individual pre - neutron emission measurements of @xcite are shown as points . the point at e@xmath1 = 14 mev is the average of @xcite and @xcite . the slope of the measured tke release ( this work ) is in rough agreement with the previous measurements @xcite at lower energies . also shown are the predictions of the gef model @xcite . gef is a semi - empirical model of fission that provides a good description of fission observables using a modest number of adjustable parameters . the dashed line in figure 1 is a semi - empirical equation ( tke = 171.5 -0.1e * for e * @xmath26 9 mev ) suggested by tudora et al . @xcite qualitatively the decrease in tke with increasing neutron energy reflects the increase in symmetric fission ( with its lower associated tke release ) with increasing excitation energy . this general dependence is reflected in the gef code predictions with the slope of our data set being similar to the predictions of the gef model but with the absolute values of the tke release being substantially less .    in figure 4 , we show some typical tke distributions along with gaussian representations of the data . in general , the tke distributions appear to be gaussian in shape . this is in contrast to previous studies @xcite which showed a sizable skewness in the distributions .    in figure 5 , we show the dependence of the measured values of the variance of the tke distributions as a function of neutron energy along with the predictions of the gef model of the same quantity . the measured variances are larger than expected . at low energies ( near the second chance fission threshold ) the observed variances show a dependence on neutron energy similar to that predicted by the gef model , presumably reflecting the changes in variance with decreasing mass asymmetry . at higher energies ( 11 - 50 mev ) the variances are roughly constant with changes in neutron energy . models @xcite would suggest that most of the variance of the tke distribution is due to fluctuations in the nascent fragment separation at scission . the constancy of the variances is puzzling .    using the q values predicted by the gef code , one can make a related plot ( fig . 6 ) of the txe values in the @xmath0u(n , f ) reaction . the  bump \" in the txe at lower neutron energies is pronounced and the dependence of the txe upon neutron energy agrees with the gef predictions although the absolute values are larger . we conclude that : ( a ) for the first time , we have measured the tke release and its variance for the technologically important @xmath0u(n , f ) reaction over a large range of neutron energies ( 3.2 - 50 mev ) . ( b ) the dependence of the tke upon e@xmath1 seems to agree with semi - empirical models although the absolute value does not .

moyal coefficients @xcite it is possible to reconstruct the dynamics of the langevin equation from given data @xcite . this idea is the foundation of the following presentation . first we focus on the wide class of nonlinear dynamical systems with dynamical noise , also known as the diffusion processes . it can be represented by a langevin equation ( in the it representation),@xmath0_{ij}\\gamma_j(t)},\\;\\;i=1,\\ldots n \\label{langevin}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes the time dependent @xmath2-dimensional stochastic state vector . the drift coefficients , @xmath3 , represent the deterministic part of the dynamics , and the diffusion coefficients , @xmath4 , determine the strength of the dynamical noise , including the general case of multiplicative noise when the coefficients @xmath4 depend on @xmath5 . @xmath6 is @xmath7-correlated gaussian noise ( langevin force ) . as known from @xcite , the drift coefficients @xmath3 are obtained as the limit of conditional moments @xmath8 @xmath9 and the diffusion coefficients @xmath4 by the moments @xmath10 @xmath11 the numerical estimations of these conditional moments are performed for @xmath12 , for a sufficiently small neighborhood @xmath13 of a fixed value @xmath14 in the phase space . these conditional moments can be estimated directly from given data sets in a parameter free way . for small @xmath15 ( i.e. smaller than the recurrent time @xcite ) the first two moments @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) are connected to the diffusion coefficient @xcite : @xmath18    if , in addition to the dynamical noise , also measurement noise is present the procedure of the estimation of @xmath19 has to be changed . the measurement noise , which is typically added by the process of measuring data , can be formulated mathematically as @xmath20 the vector @xmath21 is the sum of the state vector @xmath22 described by the dynamics of eq . ( [ langevin ] ) and measurement noise . here the measurement noise is given by its standard deviation @xmath23 and the @xmath7-correlated noise term @xmath24 . as a consequence of the definition ( [ measurement ] ) , it is easy to see that for @xmath25 the conditional moments , as defined in eqs . ( [ drift2 ] ) and ( [ diffusion2 ] ) , one obtains @xmath26 note that for the determination of @xmath27 via @xmath28 ( see equation ( [ drift2 ] ) ) no correction term appears due to the measurement noise , because it averages out . the equation ( [ k2 ] ) is valid for a sufficient small neighborhood @xmath29 so that @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be approximated by constant values in @xmath29 . furthermore the linear dependence of @xmath32 on @xmath15 can be taken as a criterion for a correct sampling frequency , which has to be chosen so high that this linearity is resolved . next we apply the method to measured data of a chaotic electronic oscillator . as a circuitry we have chosen the shinriki oscillator @xcite as shown in fig . [ fig.circuitry ] . in fig . [ fig.attractor ] exemplary phase space representations of the attractors for the measured data are shown . [ fig.attractor]a ) shows the pure deterministic chaotic dynamics , fig . [ fig.attractor]b ) the dynamics with dynamical noise , and fig . [ fig.attractor]c ) dynamics with the combination of dynamical and measurement noise . for an experimental realisation of the dynamical noise , a @xmath7-correlated noise source is in series connection to the negativ resistor . the corresponding langevin equation for the three voltages @xmath22 , describing the shinriki oscillator , see fig . [ fig.circuitry ] , are given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 describes the langevin force . for the specific parameters see fig . [ fig.circuitry ] , the negative resistor @xmath35 and @xmath36 describes the nonlinearity of the zener diodes . an empirical formular for the characteristic curve is @xmath37 where @xmath38 . the four parameters @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 have to be fitted on the measured characteristic curve . additional measurement noise was added to the data , namely to the component @xmath43 . to give evidence of the validity of our procedure for the case of dynamical noise , we show in fig . [ fig.d1shinriki ] the reconstructed deterministic part of eq . ( [ shin1 ] ) , which we obtained from measured data ( here and in the following we use 400.000 data points for our analysis ) . here an exemplary cut through @xmath46 has been chosen in such a way that the nonlinearity becomes obvious . by measuring the electronic elements ( @xmath47 and @xmath36 ) we can directly compare the characteristics gained from eq . ( [ shin1 ] ) with the reconstructed one ( see fig . [ fig.d1shinriki ] ) . the small deviations can be explained by parasitic capacitances and inductances . for analogous numerically generated data sets no significant deviation of the reconstructed values of @xmath48 was found . furthermore , we investigate the diffusion coefficients . for simplification , only the case of additive noise is considered , i.e. @xmath49 is constant . according to equations ( [ drift2 ] ) , ( [ diffusion2 ] ) and ( [ k2 ] ) we calculate @xmath50 . to improve the statistics we calculate the median of @xmath50 about the whole state space . as shown in fig . [ fig.limesshinriki ] the moments @xmath32 display a linear dependence on small @xmath15 @xcite . the slope of this dependence gives the strength of the dynamical noise @xmath49 , see eq . ( [ k2 ] ) . most remarkably @xmath32 shows an increasing off - set when the measurement noise is increased . according to equation ( [ k2 ] ) with the value of @xmath51 the strength of the measurement noise @xmath23 can be measured . our results are summarized in table [ tab.shinriki ] . the precision of these results obviously depends on the number of data points . furthermore we notice that with increasing magnitude of the measurement noise the value @xmath45 gets underestimated while the precision of the estimated @xmath49 almost remains about constant . ( @xmath52 corresponds to about @xmath53 noise . ) the second cumulant @xmath50 of eq .

( [ h ] ) . although the quantum stationary states of matter in the gravitational field is theoretically possible , the observation of such quantum effect is very difficult experimentally . this is due to the fact that the gravitational quantum effects are negligible for macroscopic objects and for charged particles the electromagnetic interaction has the dominate role . so we should use neutral elementary particles with a long lifetime such as neutrons . a few years ago , a famous measurement is performed by nesvizhevsky et al . using a high precision neutron gravitational spectrometer @xcite . in this experiment , the quantization of energy of ultra cold neutrons bouncing above a mirror in the earth s gravitational field was demonstrated .      here , we are interested to study the effects of the minimal length on the energy spectrum of a particle of mass @xmath36 which is bouncing vertically and elastically on a reflecting hard floor so that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the acceleration in the earth s gravitational field . in ordinary quantum mechanics ( @xmath11 ) , this problem is exactly solvable and the eigenfunctions can be written in the form of the airy functions . moreover , the energy eigenvalues are related to the zeros of the airy function . in the semiclassical approximation , the energy eigenvalues can be obtained using the bohr - sommerfeld formula as @xmath39 ^ 2\\right)^{1/3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is valid with a high degree of accuracy of @xmath40 even for the lowest quantum state . however , for @xmath41 the situation is quite different .    in the presence of the minimal length , it is more appropriate to study the problem in the momentum space . because of the linear form of the potential , the generalized schrdinger equation can be cast into a first - order differential equation in this space . now we define a new variable @xmath42 and rewrite the generalized schrdinger equation ( [ h0 ] ) in the momentum space as @xmath43 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath22 . this equation admits the following solution @xmath44.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a constant and @xmath46 . to proceed further and for the sake of simplicity , let us work in the units of @xmath47 . now the energy eigenvalues are the minus of the roots of the following wave function in the quasiposition space representation @xmath48e^{ipz}\\mathrm{d}p.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to evaluate the integral , it is more appropriate to use the new variable @xmath49 and write the wave function as @xmath50 this integral can be evaluated numerically and the resulting solutions for @xmath51 are depicted in fig . as the figure shows , the energy spectrum increases in the presence of the minimal length i.e. @xmath41 . the calculated energy eigenvalues for the first ten states are also shown in table [ tab1 ] which confirms the positive shift in the energy levels of the quantum bouncer in the gup framework .    the wave function @xmath52 for @xmath11 ( black line ) , @xmath53 ( green line ) , @xmath54 ( red line ) , and @xmath55 ( blue line ) . the eigenenergies are the minus of the zeros of @xmath52 and @xmath47 . , width=302 ]    .[tab1]the first ten quantized energies of a bouncing particle in gup formalism for @xmath47 .

while oxygen , with a stronger nucleus , could be affected by transport mechanisms associated with microscopic diffusion ( michaud 1988 ) . surface abundances of these three elements , showing different levels of fragility , are used to help to discriminate between different mixing mechanisms proposed . we set about measuring the be and o abundances in a group of f - type stars with available li abundances derived by balachandran ( 1990 ) . stellar parameters ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , [ fe / h ] , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 ) were also taken from this work . their masses were estimated by dividing the stars into three similar groups of metallicity and comparing their ( @xmath6,@xmath4 ) values with the evolutionary tracks of vandenberg ( 1985 ) corresponding to [ fe / h]@xmath8 , and @xmath9 , respectively .    the 51 stars observed span from 5900 to 7000 k in @xmath4 , from @xmath10 to 0.20 in [ fe / h ] , and from 0.9 to 1.7 @xmath11 . recently revised ages , based on @xmath6 values derived from _ hipparcos _ parallaxes ( ng & bertelli 1997 ) are available for 17 stars in the sample ( covering the whole range of metallicity ) , showing that the ages of the stars are within the interval of 1.8 to 6.6 gyr . a detailed abundance analysis via lte spectral synthesis has been carried out to derive beryllium abundances , using the @xmath12 3131   doublet , in 21 stars observed with @xmath13 and @xmath14 , using the utrecht echelle spectrograph at the 4.2 m william herschel telescope , and the iacub echelle spectrograph ( mckeith et al . 1993 ) at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope ( not ) , respectively , of the roque de los muchachos observatory ( la palma , spain ) . similar analyses have been carried out previously for the sun , metal - poor stars , and the hyades ( garca lpez et al . 1995a , b ) , showing the reliability of the method . the left panel of figure 1 shows the observed and synthetic spectra for one of the stars . very recently , balachandran & bell ( 1997 ) have argued that the continuous opacity in the uv region could have not been fully accounted for in previous works , providing abundances smaller than the actual ones . if this were the case , there would be an overall change of scale in the beryllium abundances derived from the @xmath12 3131.065   line . oxygen abundances of 37 stars have been derived using an nlte analysis of the infrared triplet at @xmath15 77717775  , following the prescriptions employed by garca lpez et al . the observations were carried out in two runs using iacub at the not , with resolutions @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . an example of the spectra in the region is shown in the right panel of figure 1 . figure 2 shows the be and li abundances ( where log ( x)@xmath18 ) , as well as the o abundances with respect to the sun ( [ o / h ] ) , against stellar mass . all plots have been made with the same range of abundances , and a large scatter can be seen within the be and li measurements ( filled circles ) and upper limits ( inverted open triangles ) , while the dispersion in oxygen abundances is much smaller . all be - depleted stars are also li - depleted , as is expected from their different nuclear reaction temperatures . hr6467 is the star with the least be detected ( log n(be)@xmath19 ) , and there are eight stars with detections in both be and li whose abundances are plotted in figure 3 . while the initial or `` cosmic '' lithium abundance of these f - type stars can be estimated around log n(li)@xmath20 , the initial be abundance for the eight stars could vary , in principle , depending on their metallicity ( due to the steep relation observed between be and [ fe / h ] and associated with spallation reactions between cosmic rays and c , n , and o nuclei in the interstellar medium ; e.g. rebolo et al . 1995 ; molaro et al . however , given that their range in [ fe / h ] is very small ( @xmath21 to 0.20 ) it is conceivable that their initial abundances were not very different . if so , the correlation seen in the lower panel of figure 3 and the mean ratio log ( li / be)@xmath22 obtained from these stars could be used to constrain the mechanism responsible for the li and be depletions among them . this ratio would change to a smaller value if the uv continuous opacity were wrong as suggested by balachandran & bell ( 1997 ) .    while there is no qualitative change in the distribution of be or li abundances against @xmath4 and mass , indicating that the depletion mechanism is not related only to the stellar structure , the scatter of the oxygen abundances decreases and a significant correlation appears when plotting them against mass instead of against effective temperature . we have no clear explanation for this at present , and the radiative accelerations on oxygen computed by gonzlez et al . ( 1995 ) for a- and f - type stars do not even reproduce the observed abundances . the mechanisms proposed for explaining the li depletion in f - type stars can be divided into two different groups : those which invoke nuclear burning of the li atoms and those in which this is not necessary .    from the latter group , superficial mass loss ( schramm et al . 1990 ) has been shown not to be a reliable mechanism ( e.g. swenson & faulkner 1992 ) . microscopic diffusion ( michaud 1986 ; richer & michaud 1993 ) operates where the material sinks below the surface convection zone because the internal radiation pressure is not capable of supporting the weight of the nuclide concerned . michaud ( 1988 ) suggested that if the radiative acceleration is insufficient to support li in the outer layers of an f - type star , the same could then hold for nitrogen and oxygen . however , not only do the oxygen abundances shown in figure 2 not show any sign of depletion ( either in f - type stars of open clusters ; garca lpez et al . 1993 ) , but neither do the radiative accelerations computed by gonzlez et al . ( 1995 ) reproduce the observed abundances for these elements . furthermore , recent work ( e.g. balachandran 1995 ) provides complementary information which suggests that the li depletion in old clusters is not related to microscopic diffusion . rotation plays an important role in late - type stars of open clusters , where high rotational velocities seem to inhibit the li depletion ( e.g. garca lpez et al . 1994 ; barrado y navascus & stauffer 1996 ) . mixing mechanisms directly related to rotation , such as meridional circulation ( charbonneau & michaud 1988 ) or rotationally induced turbulent mixing ( vauclair 1988 ; charbonnel et al . 1992 ) , have been proposed within the former group . while meridional circulation faces several problems in explaining the li abundances in f - type stars ( e.g. balachandran 1990 ) , rotationally induced mixing ( after adding an important amount of pre - ms li depletion ) would marginally reproduce the li and be abundances observed in the hyades ( garca lpez et al . 1995b ) . pinsonneault et al . ( 1989 , 1990 ) and deliyannis & pinsonneault ( 1992 ) computed rotating evolutionary models including angular momentum loss , in which mixing of material is associated with the transport of angular momentum in the interior of the star . although the models of pinsonneault et al . can reproduce the light - element depletion trends observed in figure 2 , they can explain the observed li and be abundances in the hyades ( where the age is fixed ) only if the initial angular momenta of the late - type stars were progressively larger for decreasing stellar mass ( garca lpez et al . very recently , however , deliyannis et al . ( 1997 ; private communication ) show that the predictions from rotating models can follow the be vs. li trend observed in an independent sample of stars . a different constraint on the rotation - induced turbulent diffusion used by pinsonneault et al . ( 1989 ) comes from the fact that this model fails to extract sufficient angular momentum from the radiative solar interior to achieve the flat rotation profile revealed by helioseismology ( brown et al . 1989 ) . garca lpez & spruit ( 1991 ) proposed a mixing mechanism for f - type stars based on a weak turbulence induced by internal gravity waves , which is able to explain the li abundances in the pleiades and hyades , as well as the be measurements in the hyades . the waves are generated by the fluctuating pressure of the convective cells at the base of the convection zone . a different version of this formalism was developed and successfully applied to the sun ( montalbn 1994 ) and to late - type stars of the hyades ( montalbn & schatzman 1996 ) . however , the published mechanism for f - type stars , which was developed using several simplifying assumptions and aimed at testing the importance of the waves in inducing mixing in these stars , does not predict a large be depletion for stars of about 1 gyr ( such as those observed in figure 2 ) . this is now under revision by applying a more refined convection treatment . furthermore , the mechanism was linked to the stellar mass and age providing abundances which depend only on these parameters , in contradiction with the observations . however , a high rotational velocity could change the temperature distribution in the stellar interior ( martn & claret 1996 ) , or it could also block the mechanical energy transfer and/or the generation of internal waves at the base of the convection zone ( spruit 1987 ; schatzman 1993 ) , thus providing ways in which the mixing induced by the waves is linked to the rotational velocities , and not only to the stellar structure . very recently , zahn et al . ( 1997 ) and kumar & quataert ( 1997 ) have found that internal gravity waves are also able to transport angular momentum in the stellar interior , operating on a time scale of 10@xmath23 yr for the solar case , and being consistent with the rotation profile provided by helioseismology . a similar large scatter ( @xmath24 dex ) have been found for li and be abundances in the sample of old f - type stars studied . there is a similar distribution of light element abundances when plotted against @xmath4 and mass , indicating that the depletion mechanism is not related only to the stellar structure . oxygen abundances are within @xmath25 dex of the solar value ( except for the most massive star showing [ o / h]@xmath26 ) , and appear to be correlated with increasing stellar mass . the abundances are much higher than those predicted by theoretical radiative accelerations and do not show any dramatic sign of microscopic diffusion . beryllium and lithium have been simultaneously detected in eight stars with a @xmath27 dex range of depletions . assuming similar li and be initial abundances for all of them ( within a small range of [ fe / h ] ) , their li / be ratio would serve to constrain proposed mixing mechanisms .    since there are physical mechanisms linking the transport of angular momentum and mixing of material in late - type stars to the presence and propagation of internal gravity waves in the stellar interior , which satisfy observational constraints imposed by the solar rotation profile and the light element abundances in the sun and in two open clusters , and ways have been suggested of relating the production and/or efficiency of the waves to the stellar rotational velocity , the internal gravity waves within the framework of rotating evolutionary models appear as a very promising consistent explanation for the li and be abundances observed in different open clusters and the field , including the dispersions found at a given @xmath4 or mass . mixing directly associated with the transport of angular momentum in the stellar interior is considered also as a possible explanation .
