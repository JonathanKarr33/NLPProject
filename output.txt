Building Thermal Model We developed our simulation around
our abstract thermal model for office buildings, shown in Figure 1.
We
also define a custom feedback signal, or reward, that indicates the
quality of taking an action in the current state, as a weighted sum of
negative cost functions for carbon emission, energy consumption,
and zone-level setpoint deviation.
We
note that while RL is the control method proposed in this work, our
calibrated simulator is useful as well for other controller methods
such as Model Predictive Control [9].
It should be noted that an uncalibrated model had a
much larger error of 2.1◦.
Therefore, it is necessary to train in an offline
sandbox environment that adequately emulates the dynamics of
the building before being deployed on the actual building.
The ring of blue around the building indicates that our
simulator is too cold on the perimeter, which implies that the heat
exchange with the outside is happening more rapidly than it would
in the real world.
We selected water supply temperature ˆ and the air handler
supply temperature ˆ as agent actions because they affect the
balance of electricity and natural gas consumption, they affect
multiple device interactions, and they affect occupant comfort.
For the different
time of day scenario, we observe a larger drift of 1.2◦, and the me-
dian is shifted as well, indicated that tuning on one time of day is
not as useful when making predictions on another.
The second and
third telemetry intervals, (b) and (c), were used for validation.
This was not used in the tuning process, but gives us
some insight into how well the calibration process is performing.
Our approach uses a physics-based
simulator that achieves an ideal balance between speed and fidelity,
which is sufficient to train an effective control agent off-line.
Fidelity is the simulator’s ability to
reproduce the building’s true dynamics that affect the optimization
process.
The inside of the building remains red, which
means that despite the simulator perimeter being cooler than the
real world, the inside is warmer.
We also employ a user interface
to label the location of each HVAC device on the floorplan grid.
4 EXPERIMENT RESULTS
We now demonstrate the results of how our simulator, when tuned
and calibrated, is able to make real-world predictions.
2 RELATED WORK
Considerable attention has been paid to HVAC control in recent
years, and a growing portion of that has considered how RL and its
various associated algorithms can be leveraged [8, 14, 20, 23, 24].
To configure the simulator, we require
floorplans, and HVAC metadata.
The action on the building  is a fixed-
length vector of device setpoints selected by the agent at time ,
such as the boiler’s supply water temperature setpoint, etc.
Our
contributions include a highly customizable and scalable HVAC and
building simulator, a rapid configuration method to customize the
simulator to a particular building, a calibration method to improve

Each control volume is a narrow volume bounded horizontally,
parameterized by Δ 2, and vertically by the height of the floor.
Next, we calculate our sim-
ulation fidelity metric, which is the mean absolute error of the
measured zone air temperatures, at the  th timestep.
Special control volumes associated with air diffusers
allow thermal energy exchange between the HVAC model and the
FD grid, (cid:164) .
We preprocess the detailed floor-
plan blueprints of the building, and extract a grid that gives us an
approximate placement of walls.
The first telemetry interval,
(a), was used to tune the simulator for calibration.

Simulator Calibration Once we defined our simulation fidelity
metric, we can minimize the error by searching over the physical
parameters that affect the simulation response.
Experiment Setup To test out our simulator, we obtained teleme-
try recordings from our pilot building, a commercial office building
located in Mountain View, California.
Each iteration
step of our simulator was designed to represent a five minute in-
terval, and our real world data is also sampled in five minute in-
tervals.
At each time step, we plot the real world
temperatures in a blue boxplot and the simulator ones in orange.
Red re-
gions indicate the simulator was warmer than the validation data,
blue regions indicate cooler, and white regions had no temperature
difference.
Given floorplans and HVAC layout information, a single
technician was able to generate a fully specified simulation in under
3 hours that matched the real building in every device and room.
We then initialize the simulator so that its ini-
tial state matches that of the starting observation, and run the
simulator for  steps, replaying the same HVAC policy as was
used in the real world observations.
As indicated in Table 2, our tuning procedure drifts only 0.6◦ on
average over a 6 hour period on the tuning set, and we get good

generalization: almost identical error for the same time period of a
different day.
We suspect these errors are largely due to assuming thermal isola-
tion between floors and assuming no radiative exchange with the
outside.
Overview of the HVAC problem Most office buildings are
equipped with advanced HVAC devices, like Variable Air Volume
(VAV) devices, Hot Water Systems (HWS), Air Conditioner (AC)
and Air Handlers that are configured and tuned by the engineers,
manufacturers, installers, and operators to run efficiently with the
device’s local control loops [15].
HVAC Model The HVAC system is modeled as an energy bal-
ance with a lossy thermal exchange between the hot water and air
circuits, evaluating temperature differences, and air and water flow
rates with efficiency parameters.
This method divides each floor of the building into
a grid of three-dimensional control volumes and applies thermal
diffusion equations to estimate the temperature of each control
volume.
By assuming each floor is thermally isolated, (i.e., no heat
is transferred between floors), we can simplify the three-spatial
dimensions into a spatial two-dimensional heat transfer problem.
The parameters varied, the sweep range limits, and the
values found that minimized the calibration metric are shown in
Table 1.
Offline RL: The second approach is to train the agent directly
from the historical real world data, without ever producing an in-
teractive environment [4–6].
However, integrating multiple
HVAC devices from diverse vendors into a building “system re-
quires technicians to program fixed operating conditions for these
units, which may not be optimal for every building and every poten-
tial weather condition.
The
energy balance, shown below, is applied to each discrete control
volume in the FD grid, and consists of the following components:
(a) the thermal exchange across each face of the four participating
faces control volume via conduction or convection 1, 2, 3, 4,
(b) the change in internal energy over time in the control volume
 Δ
Δ , and (c) an external energy source that enables applying
local thermal energy from the HVAC model only for those control
volumes that include an airflow diffuser,  .
The variables tuned
during the parameter search included the following: (a) the forced
convection coefficient quantifying outside wind and air currents
against the building exterior surfaces; (b) the thermal conductivity,
heat capacity, and density of exterior and interior walls; and (c)
the shuffle probability that controls how likely an air volume will
be exchanged with another within the zone to approximate the
internal air circulation and interior forced convection.
We obtained floor plan blueprints and used them to
configure a customized simulator for the building, a process that
took a single human less than three hours to complete.
We note that heat transfer using air
circulation is effectively the exchange of air mass between control
volumes, which we approximate by a randomized shuffling of air
within zones, parameterized by a shuffle probability.
However, the external convection coefficient
was higher than under normal weather conditions, and likely is
compensating for radiative losses and gains, which were not directly
Calibration Results Table 2 shows the  -step prediction fi-
delity, as MAE, over a six-hour prediction window ( = 72).
To meet these requirements
we designed a lightweight simulator based on Finite Differences
approximation of heat exchange, with a novel automated procedure
to go from building floor plans to a custom simulator with little
manual effort.
While the real world data is obviously
of high accuracy and quality, this presents a major challenge, since
the agent cannot take actions in the real world and interact with
any form of an environment, severely limiting its ability to improve
over the baseline policy that produced the real world data [10].
The difficulty here is that data-driven
models often do not generalize well to circumstances outside the
training distribution, especially since they are not physics based.
If existing setpoint control policies are not
optimal under all conditions, the possibility exists that an ML model
may be trained to continuously tune a small number of setpoints
to achieve greater energy efficiency and reduced carbon emission
RL for HVAC systems We define the state of the office building
 at time  as a fixed length vector of measurements from sensors on
the building’s devices, such as a specific VAV’s zone air temperature,
gas meter’s flow rate, etc.
Speed refers to both simulator configuration time, and
agent training time, i.e., the time necessary for the agent to optimize
its policy using the simulator.
